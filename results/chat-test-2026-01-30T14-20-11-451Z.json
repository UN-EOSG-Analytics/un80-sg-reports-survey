Introduction \\n \\n \\n1. \\nRacism is fundamentally a system of power based on the false notion of racial \\nhierarchies and woven into the fabric of societies and institutions to justify the \\nsubjugation of people of colour. It is deeply rooted in the transatlantic trade in \\nenslaved Africans, colonialism and apartheid. It is a system used to justify the unequal \\ndistribution of power and privilege. This historical legacy continues to have an impact \\non societies today with ongoing, detrimental consequences for racialized \\ncommunities, which remain subjected to pervasive inequities in areas such as \\neducation, healthcare, employment, justice and wealth. \\n2. \\nAddressing racism transcends managing individual incidents and requires a \\ncomprehensive approach to dismantle its historical and systemic roots. In that regard, \\nthe approach adopted by the Anti-Racism Office is to focus on the future, recognizing \\nthat no one is born a racist and that racism is a social construct that can, with great \\neffort, be eliminated. \\n3. \\nThe presence of racism and racial discrimination in the United Nations system \\nundermines the Organization’s standing as a global standard-bearer of human rights. \\nMost importantly, racism and racial discrimination debase the Organization’s most \\nvaluable asset, its staff, thus negatively affecting the effective discharge of its \\nmandates. As the world’s premier intergovernmental organization, the United Nations \\nis uniquely placed to demonstrate that workplaces with racially inclusive policies that \\nrespect the dignity of all are better equipped to deliver on global mandates geared \\ntowards diverse situations and peoples.  \\n4. \\nOver the years, the Secretariat has made efforts to examine and combat racism and \\nracial discrimination following General Assembly resolutions 31/26, 53/221 and 76/271. \\nHowever, findings from the 2020 United Nations survey on racism presented in the report \\nof the Secretary-General’s Task Force on Addressing Racism and Promoting Dignity for \\nAll in the United Nations Secretariat confirmed the continued presence of racism and \\nracial discrimination within the Organization. Pursuant to Assembly resolution 76/271, \\nin 2022 the Secretariat initiated the implementation of the strategic action plan on \\naddressing racism and promoting dignity for all in the United Nations Secretariat. \\n5. \\nFollowing General Assembly resolution 78/253, the Anti-Racism Office was \\nestablished in the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance to \\nspearhead and oversee the implementation of the strategic action plan, with its sole \\nfocus being to address racism and racial discrimination in the workplace. The Office \\noperates under the substantive guidance of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\\nGeneral for Addressing Racism in the Workplace and the managerial oversight of the \\nUnder-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. The \\nImplementation Steering Group, created in 2022 to oversee the operationalization, \\nimplementation and mainstreaming of the strategic action plan, continues to provide \\noverall leadership and guidance to those charged with the plan’s implementation, in \\naddition to providing regular progress reports to the Secretary-General. \\n6. \\nTo ensure the integration and mainstreaming of anti-racism activities throughout \\nthe Organization, the Anti-Racism Office established a network of anti-racism \\nadvocates located in duty stations across the global Secretariat, who are the drivers of \\nchange at the entity level. The Office also collaborates with key departments and \\noffices in the Secretariat, such as the Office of Human Resources, the Office of Support \\nOperations, the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services, the \\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and the Office of Administration of \\nJustice, to examine and reformulate policies, practices and norms that may hinder \\nracial diversity and dignity for all. Moreover, close engagement with staff unions and \\naffinity groups, as well as United Nations system-wide entities, allows the \\nAnti-Racism Office to exchange information on best practices and lessons learned.  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469 \\n \\n25-20593\\n4/16 \\n \\n \\nII. The imperative to address racism and racial discrimination \\n \\n \\n7. \\nIn 2021, the Secretary-General issued the report on addressing racism and \\npromoting dignity for all in the United Nations Secretariat and its corresponding strategic \\naction plan. The need to address racism and racial discrimination was also underscored \\nby the Joint Inspection Unit in its note entitled “Review of measures and mechanisms for \\naddressing racism and racial discrimination in United Nations system organizations: \\nmanaging for achieving organizational effectiveness” (JIU/NOTE/2022/1/Rev.1). Staff \\nviews expressed through the racism survey undertaken in 2020 and the staff engagement \\nsurvey in 2021 confirmed the urgency of combating racism in the Secretariat. \\n8. \\nToday, the imperative to address racism and racial discrimination in the \\nOrganization remains, as attested by: (a) the staff engagement survey conducted in \\n2024; (b) the continuing engagements of the Special Adviser with United Nations \\nstaff across the Secretariat; and (c) a recent analysis undertaken by the Secretariat of \\nthe staff composition between 2023 and 2025.  \\n \\n \\n \\nResults of the 2024 staff engagement survey \\n \\n9. \\nSince 2021, the United Nations staff engagement survey has included questions \\non racism and racial discrimination. The responses are a key tool to monitor and \\nevaluate experiences of discrimination, identify ongoing issues relating to reporting \\nmisconduct, and understand whether any progress has been made in addressing racism \\nand racial discrimination in the Secretariat. \\n10. The 2024 survey showed that racism and racial discrimination remain key focus \\nareas for Secretariat staff. The survey garnered a response rate of 42 per cent \\n(approximately 15,000 staff members) with staff who self-identified as “Black or \\nAfro-descent” and “White” having the highest participation rates. Secretariat staff \\nwho responded to the staff engagement survey self-identified as follows:  \\n \\nCategory \\nNumber \\nPercentage \\nBlack or Afro-descent \\n3 390 \\n24 \\nCentral Asian \\n356 \\n2 \\nEast Asian \\n573 \\n4 \\nLatino/a or Hispanic \\n1 085 \\n8 \\nMultiracial \\n558 \\n4 \\nNorth African/Middle Eastern \\n933 \\n7 \\nNot listed \\n640 \\n4 \\nPrefer not to disclose \\n1 723 \\n12 \\nSouth Asian \\n637 \\n4 \\nSouth-East Asian \\n629 \\n4 \\nWhite \\n3 763 \\n26 \\nTotal \\n14 287 \\n100 \\n \\n \\n11. \\nQuestions in the staff engagement survey relating to racism and racial \\ndiscrimination addressed issues such as tolerance of racial discrimination in the \\nworkplace, leadership commitment to addressing racism and racial discrimination, \\nimpact of training programmes, and understanding of where to report racism and \\nracial discrimination. Survey respondents who reported having been discriminated \\nagainst were asked further questions on how they responded to the discrimination, \\nwhether they had reported it, and satisfaction with how reports were handled. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469\\n \\n5/16\\n25-20593 \\n \\n12. The 2024 survey results demonstrated that racism and discrimination continue \\nto be prevalent concerns for Secretariat staff. Results remained largely consistent with \\ntrends measured by previous staff engagement surveys starting in 2021. Twenty-five \\nper cent of respondents in 2024 felt that they were not guaranteed equal opportunities \\nat work due to a number of factors, including race, skin colour and national or ethnic \\norigin. Findings also showed that 33 per cent of those respondents who reported that \\nthey had been discriminated against indicated that critical incidents or misconduct \\nwere not reported due to a lack of trust in the reporting system, with 48 per cent \\nindicating a fear of retaliation. Over half of respondents who indicated that they had \\nreported cases expressed dissatisfaction with how incidents were resolved. \\n13. The results of the 2024 staff engagement survey demonstrate the need for \\ncontinued engagement with staff and stakeholders on all three pillars of the work of \\nthe Anti-Racism Office (advocacy and awareness-raising, transparency and \\ninstitutional reform, and accountability and racial justice) to improve perceptions and \\nexperiences related to racism and racial discrimination in the Secretariat.  \\n \\n \\n \\nSpecial Adviser’s engagement with staff and the United Nations system \\n \\n14. To advance the strategic action plan and directly engage with United Nations \\nstaff and leadership in the field, the Special Adviser undertook a mission to Ethiopia, \\nKenya and Somalia from 28 April to 6 May 2025. The mission was aimed at evaluating \\nprogress in implementing the strategic action plan and better understanding staff \\nexperiences and perceptions of racism in the workplace. It included engagements with \\npersonnel in the Economic Commission for Africa, the United Nations Environment \\nProgramme, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the \\nUnited Nations Office at Nairobi, the United Nations Support Office in Somalia and \\nthe United Nations Transitional Assistance Mission in Somalia. \\n15. During these engagements, staff members raised several issues, pointing to \\nstructural disparities across various recruitment and human resources management \\npractices, as well as incidents of overt racist behaviour in the workplace which have \\nled to significant mental health issues. A prevalent fear of retaliation still prevents \\nmany from coming forward to report incidents of racial discrimination. More broadly, \\nstaff members relayed fear and uncertainty about the impact of UN80 reforms on \\nthem, which might have a disproportional impact on people of colour. In response, \\nthe Special Adviser reiterated that, as the Organization underwent restructuring, it \\nmust be highly aware of and actively guard against reproducing old racial hierarchies. \\nUltimately, the success of this reform hinged on its ability to decisively correct \\nhistorical exclusions, rather than inadvertently entrench them.  \\n16. Specific concerns raised by staff included stalled implementation of the strategic \\naction plan and marginalization in relation to mobility and access to global roles. Staff \\nhave spoken openly – often identifying themselves – about racial bias in deployment \\nand promotion, lack of inclusive leadership development, exclusion of General \\nService staff and contractors from anti-racism efforts, and fears that UN80 reforms \\ncould reverse recent gains. Some staff felt that training and travel opportunities were \\nalso clouded by perceptions of racial bias. On a positive note, one anti-racism \\nadvocate created the Supporting Holistic Anti-Racism Efforts (SHARE) Team, which \\nwas recognized as a model to be replicated in other entities. \\n17. The Special Adviser also convened hybrid town hall meetings that reached \\npersonnel in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the Department of \\nManagement Strategy, Policy and Compliance, the Department of Peace Operations, \\nthe Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, the Department for General \\nAssembly and Conference Management, the Department of Global Communications, \\nthe Department of Safety and Security and the Development Coordination Office. The \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469 \\n \\n25-20593\\n6/16 \\n \\nSpecial Adviser also held virtual town hall meetings for the United Nations Assistance \\nMission in Afghanistan and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. At these \\nmeetings, concerns raised by staff included subtle but entrenched racism in \\nrecruitment and daily interactions, denial of racism by some managers, burden-of-\\nproof challenges, exclusion of national staff perspectives, elitism favouring graduates \\nof prestigious global North universities, and tokenistic implementation of diversity \\nmeasures. At one such meeting, specific allegations of racism were raised openly \\nagainst a manager who was in the room. \\n18. Across all duty stations, staff consistently requested stronger accountability \\nmechanisms. They also directed complaints and reported racism to the Special \\nAdviser and occasionally to the Anti-Racism Office, despite neither being mandated \\nto process them. Submissions included allegations of racial discrimination in the \\nworkplace and racial bias in appointments and promotions, and, where appropriate, \\nformal complaints were shared with OIOS for proper follow-up and investigation. \\nHowever, in many instances staff members just wanted to share their experiences and \\nrefused to lodge formal complaints due to a lack of trust in the system of \\nadministration of justice and fear of potential reprisals.  \\n19. \\nBeyond the Secretariat, the Special Adviser delivered a presentation to the United \\nNations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination in Santiago in May 2024, \\nhighlighting the urgency of addressing racism across the United Nations system and of \\npromoting a coordinated response. She further engaged with agencies, funds and \\nprogrammes through the Geneva Alliance against Racism and participated in the senior \\nwomen’s leadership retreats organized by the Deputy Secretary-General, to advance \\ndiscussions on inclusive leadership and accountability. The Special Adviser also met \\nwith heads of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes based in East Africa \\nduring her visit to Nairobi. In addition, the Special Adviser’s team gave briefings on \\nthe work of the Anti-Racism Office at multiple orientation programmes organized by \\nthe United Nations System Staff College for Junior Professional Officers across the \\nUnited Nations system.  \\n \\n \\n \\nAnalysis of recent staff composition \\n \\n20. In the absence of race-related data in the Organization’s enterprise systems, \\ngeographical regions of Member States are used as a proxy. It is crucial to \\nacknowledge that geographical regions of Member States as a proxy for race-related \\ndata do not provide a full understanding of racial identity. It is also understood that \\ngeographical regions are not homogeneous and exhibit a degree of racial diversity. \\nWhile the data analysis does not directly measure the impact of systemic and \\nstructural racism on the Organization’s recruitment policies, processes and \\nprocedures, it does offer valuable indicative evidence regarding the application of the \\nstaff selection system based on geographical regions of Member States. The analysis \\nfollows a similar approach to that in the reports of the Secretary-General on the \\ncomposition of the Secretariat: staff demographics. \\n21. \\nTo implement its mandates, the Secretariat relied on a workforce of 35,231 as at \\n31 December 2024, including 881 staff who supplemented the workforce with \\ntemporary assistance for meetings, staff on when-actually-employed contracts and staff \\nwith one-dollar-per-year contracts. Among those staff members, 41 per cent are serving \\nin the Professional and higher categories. Figure I shows the regional distribution of \\nstaff employed in the Secretariat in the Professional and higher categories.  \\n \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469\\n \\n7/16\\n25-20593 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure I \\n \\n \\nSecretariat staff in the Professional and higher categories, by geographical region \\nof Member States, as at 31 December 2024 \\n(Number and percentage) \\n(Population: 13,585 staff)a \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\na Excludes 881 staff who supplement the workforce with temporary assistance for meetings, \\nstaff on when-actually-employed contracts and staff with one-dollar-per-year contracts. \\n \\n \\n22. Table 1 reveals disparities, showing that not all groups have the same share of \\ndecision-making roles (P-5, D-1, D-2) that they do of the Professional and higher \\ncategories as a whole. Specifically, the share of decision-making roles is lower for \\nAfricans and Asians and higher for staff from the Americas, Europe and Oceania. \\n \\nTable 1 \\nSummary of staff members, appointments and promotions in the Professional and higher categories, by \\ngeographical region \\n(Number and percentage) \\n \\n \\nAfrica \\n \\nAmericas \\n \\nAsia \\n \\nEurope \\n \\nOceania \\n \\nNumber Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage \\nTotal \\nStaff in the Professional and \\nhigher categories \\n2 889 \\n21.3 \\n2 681 \\n19.7 \\n2 790 \\n20.5 \\n4 924 \\n36.2 \\n301 \\n2.2 13 585 \\nStaff at the P-5, D-1 and D-2 \\nlevels  \\n541 \\n20.0 \\n551 \\n20.4 \\n478 \\n17.7 \\n1 041 \\n38.6 \\n89 \\n3.3 \\n2 700 \\nAppointments at the P-5, D-1 \\nand D-2 levels \\n205 \\n25.0 \\n166 \\n20.3 \\n144 \\n17.6 \\n278 \\n33.9 \\n26 \\n3.2 \\n819 \\nPromotions at the P-5, D-1 \\nand D-2 levels \\n205 \\n21.4 \\n200 \\n20.9 \\n163 \\n17.1 \\n361 \\n37.8 \\n27 \\n2.8 \\n956 \\n \\nNote: Staff population as at 31 December 2024, excluding staff who supplemented the workforce with temporary assistance for \\nmeetings, staff on when-actually-employed contracts and staff with one-dollar-per-year contracts.

Activities undertaken to address racism and racial \\ndiscrimination in the United Nations Secretariat \\n \\n \\n27. The Secretary-General’s strategic action plan on addressing racism and \\npromoting dignity for all in the United Nations Secretariat is the road map for targeted \\nactions to combat racism and racial discrimination at the interpersonal, institutional, \\nstructural and systemic levels. The Anti-Racism Office has been spearheading the \\nimplementation of the strategic action plan using resources approved by the General \\nAssembly in its resolution 78/253. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469 \\n \\n25-20593\\n10/16 \\n \\n28. The Anti-Racism Office continued to implement the strategic action plan through \\nits three-pronged approach, consisting of the following action pillars: advocacy and \\nawareness-raising; transparency and institutional reform; and accountability and racial \\njustice. The Office undertook its activities in collaboration with anti-racism advocates \\nand relevant partners across the Secretariat. To promote engagement, coordination and \\ncomplementarity and to prevent duplication, the Office convenes several recurring \\nmeetings: quarterly meetings with anti-racism advocates, principals of relevant \\nentities involved in implementing the strategic action plan, and working-level, \\nthematic working groups tied to the three aforementioned action pillars; biannual \\nmeetings with staff unions, national staff associations, and staff affinity groups such \\nas the United Nations People of African Descent and the United Nations Asia Network \\nfor Diversity and Inclusion; and an annual retreat that brings together all designated \\nactors from various entities involved in the implementation of this mandate. In \\naddition, the Special Adviser annually convenes and chairs three meetings of the \\nImplementation Steering Group, which is composed of senior United Nations leaders \\nand external experts and provides high-level guidance for the activities of the \\nAnti-Racism Office and its partners across the Secretariat. All these meetings provide \\nstructured frameworks for multiple stakeholders to discuss, build and coordinate \\nsynergies towards the effective implementation of the strategic action plan.  \\n29. As requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 78/253, the Anti-Racism \\nOffice has refined the strategic action plan. This refinement does not aim to replace \\nthe existing action plan but rather to provide an update focused on three key areas: \\n \\n• Ensuring that the plan is focused exclusively on addressing racism and racial \\ndiscrimination \\n \\n• Updating the definitions of critical concepts related to racism and racial \\ndiscrimination to account for evolving understandings \\n \\n• Including additional implementation actions \\nThe refinement of the strategic action plan was undertaken through a consultative \\nprocess with the anti-racism advocates and other relevant stakeholders in the Secretariat. \\n30. The activities undertaken by the Anti-Racism Office in collaboration with its \\npartners in the Secretariat and the broader United Nations system during the reporting \\nperiod are presented below under headings corresponding to the three action pillars. \\n \\n \\n \\nA. Advocacy and awareness-raising \\n \\n \\n31. \\nThrough activities aimed at raising awareness about racism and racial \\ndiscrimination, as well as fostering dialogue and learning, the work under this pillar is \\nfocused on changing the organizational culture and building a workplace free of racism. \\n32. In terms of training, the Anti-Racism Office, in collaboration with the Office of \\nHuman Resources, finalized the Secretariat’s first ever course on racism, entitled \\n“Addressing racism and racial discrimination in the workplace”, which was launched \\non 4 December 2025 in English and French, with other official languages to follow. \\nThis online self-paced basic awareness course is intended to be made mandatory for \\nall personnel.  \\n33. The Anti-Racism Office also organized, in collaboration with an external \\nconsultancy firm, various anti-racism training programmes in 2023, 2024 and 2025. \\nThese were directed at specialized groups such as the anti-racism advocates, senior \\nleaders, managers at the D-1 and D-2 levels, staff counsellors, conduct and discipline \\nofficers, investigators, human resources chiefs, legal officers and members of the \\nOffice of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services. Topics included \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469\\n \\n11/16\\n25-20593 \\n \\nfoundational anti-racism skills, psychological safety, the role of the United Nations \\nin addressing racism, anti-racism leadership, anti-racism allyship, and racial healing. \\nParticipants were also trained on how to facilitate difficult discussions and foster \\nconstructive dialogue. These training courses were taken by 531 participants, \\nincluding 79 at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General levels \\nand additional colleagues from the wider United Nations system.  \\n34. Meanwhile, in 2025 the Department of Operational Support launched a course \\nentitled “Brave conversations: building thriving teams together”, which contained \\nanti-racism elements and was accompanied by an interactive card exercise designed \\nto spark open dialogue, critical thinking and meaningful reflections around the \\nconcept of psychological safety. The Department also published an updated and \\nenhanced version of “The art of hiring talent”, incorporating recommendations and \\nbest practices from the Anti-Racism Office on staff selection.  \\n35. Regarding the creation of spaces and platforms for staff to share experiences, ask \\nquestions and contribute to shaping the Organization’s anti-racism agenda, the \\nAnti-Racism Office organized 10 advocacy and awareness-raising events, including \\nthe “United against racism” live talks and anti-racism conversations. Topics included \\naddressing racial bias, reporting racism complaints, promoting upstanding and allyship \\nand decolonizing minds. During these events, the Anti-Racism Office engaged a range \\nof distinguished external speakers who interacted directly with staff and responded to \\ntheir questions, fostering deeper reflection on racism, identity and justice across the \\nUnited Nations. Among them were Djamila Ribeiro (Brazil), philosopher, writer and \\nactivist; Trevor Manuel (South Africa), former minister; Mamadou Diouf (Senegal), \\nhistorian at Columbia University; Gay McDougall (United States of America), \\nmember of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; Constance \\nMayer (United States of America), Chief of Diversity and Inclusion at the Department \\nof State; Afua Hirsch (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), \\njournalist, author and broadcaster; Albie Sachs (South Africa), former judge of the \\nConstitutional Court; and Penelope Andrews (South Africa), law professor and \\nDirector of New York Law School’s Racial Justice Project. These sessions reached \\nover 27,000 staff members globally and generated more than 4,000 comments and \\nquestions. The United against Racism iSeek page and dedicated UN Web TV channel \\nreceived more than 12,000 visits, demonstrating sustained staff interest. \\n36. The United Nations anti-racism advocates are the drivers of the implementation \\nof the strategic action plan at the entity level. During the reporting period, the \\nAnti-Racism Office expanded this global network, which now includes 146 \\nanti-racism advocates and alternates as well as over 75 working group members \\nserving across 85 Secretariat entities worldwide. To strengthen their capacity, the \\nAnti-Racism Office works closely with the network, providing the advocates with \\ntraining, an online resource hub and a platform for internal communication.  \\n37. Across duty stations, the anti-racism advocates organized a variety of activities. \\nFor example, in Mogadishu, they organized an anti-racism retreat and a series of staff \\ndiscussions, established a library of anti-racism literature to foster learning and worked \\nwith leadership to establish measures for anti-racism accountability. In Entebbe, \\nUganda, advocates organized film screenings followed by discussions to raise \\nawareness. In Geneva, in addition to entity-focused training and discussions, they \\norganized an anti-racism-focused picnic for staff to support each other. In Naqurah, \\nLebanon, the advocates formed dedicated working groups of staff volunteers who \\norganized regular dialogues on anti-racism. Meanwhile, the anti-racism working group \\nin Vienna was instrumental in constituting peer support groups for colleagues who \\nexperience racial discrimination. Other advocates incorporated anti-racism into \\ninduction training, conducted internal surveys to assess staff perceptions of racism, \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469 \\n \\n25-20593\\n12/16 \\n \\ncreated podcasts, produced articles to raise awareness about racism in the workplace, \\nand worked closely with their senior leaders to develop entity-specific action plans. A \\nmajor task being undertaken by the advocates is the Diversity in Leadership \\nTransparency Project, which entails the publication of the names, photos, nationalities, \\nlevels and titles of all senior leaders at the D-1 level and above. As of November 2025, \\n50 per cent of the 85 entities have completed the project. Overall, despite all the \\nchallenges they face, the anti-racism advocates have consistently served as the \\nbackbone for implementing the strategic action plan within their respective entities. \\n38. The Anti-Racism Office hosted the United Nations Conference on Addressing \\nRacism and Promoting Dignity for All at the Secretariat in Lisbon from 9 to 12 June \\n2025. The conference was made possible through the support of the Government of \\nPortugal and an additional contribution from the Government of the United Kingdom \\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The conference brought together 50 \\nparticipants from duty stations across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle \\nEast and North America, the majority of whom were anti-racism advocates. The \\nconference was aimed at sharing information and fostering a cohesive anti-racism \\ncommunity with a common vision to accelerate the implementation of the strategic \\naction plan. Participants had the opportunity to engage with guest speakers from the \\nhost country, South Africa and the United Kingdom from sectors as diverse as \\ngovernment, civil society, academia, corporate business and the arts. The discussions \\ncovered topics such as the systemic and historical nature of racism; racial bias in \\nrecruitment and staff management processes; accountability and racial justice; \\ncollection and analysis of race data; and mediation support and anti-retaliation \\nmechanisms. Tangible outcomes included a clear implementation timeline for \\nactivities in 2026–2028; a robust engagement strategy for anti-racism stakeholders \\nacross the Secretariat; the approval of a toolkit for anti-racism advocates entitled \\n“Facilitating discussions on race, racism and racial discrimination in the workplace”; \\nand a symbolic pledge to combat racism and racial discrimination in the Secretariat \\nthat was signed by all participants.  \\n \\n \\n \\nB. Transparency and institutional reform  \\n \\n \\n39. The work under this pillar is focused on collecting and analysing data to \\nunderstand the racial composition of the Secretariat's workforce and applicant pool \\nand examine potential bias in recruitment, appointments, promotions, mobility, roster \\nmanagement and career satisfaction opportunities. This pillar also addresses the \\nreview of institutional policies and practices that may appear neutral but could lead \\nto racial inequities. The ultimate aim is to identify systemic or institutional \\ndiscriminatory provisions and subsequently, where necessary, amend existing policies \\nor introduce new ones. \\n40. Key stakeholders in this pillar include the Anti-Racism Office, the Department \\nof Operational Support and the Office of Human Resources. The Organization, \\nfollowing a number of comprehensive reviews on reducing recruitment bias, is \\noperationalizing key recommendations. New elements include requiring geographical \\ndiversity on interview panels and moving to a new structured interview model under \\nthe staff selection system policy effective 1 October 2025. The Department of \\nOperational Support is also undertaking measures to reduce bias, including racial \\nbias, in the generic rostering process and developing a machine learning framework \\nto identify and measure potential bias in recruitment. Furthermore, in June 2025, the \\nTalent Finder tool was implemented to proactively enable hiring teams to reach out \\nto qualified candidates from unrepresented and underrepresented nationalities.  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469\\n \\n13/16\\n25-20593 \\n \\n41. Moreover, the staff selection 2.0 project is implementing key initiatives to \\nremove barriers in recruitment and make recruitment more effective, fair, efficient \\nand agile. Staff selection 2.0 is expected to have a positive impact in reducing \\npotential racial discrimination in recruitment. Initiatives under staff selection 2.0 \\ninclude undertaking inclusive job analysis and updating job profiles to provide for \\nskills-based recruitment; developing options for assessment methodologies to fulfil \\nthe universality objective, including interview methods; professionalizing recruiters; \\nand enhancing data capabilities to allow real-time monitoring, with a view to ensuring \\nthat the recruitment process is evaluated for fairness and decisions are continuously \\nmonitored for potential bias and accuracy, permitting evidence-informed adjustments.  \\n42. Regarding data collection and analysis, and in response to the General \\nAssembly’s request in resolution 78/253, the Anti-Racism Office, in collaboration \\nwith the Department of Operational Support and the Office of Information and \\nCommunications Technology, established a framework for the collection of race data \\nfrom staff, affiliate personnel and job applicants. The collection of race data is \\nexpected to begin via Inspira as early as possible in 2026. \\n43. Race data will be provided voluntarily, used in an anonymized and aggregated \\nform, kept confidential and used only to understand racism and racial discrimination \\nin the Secretariat and to take remedial actions to reverse patterns of racism and racial \\ndiscrimination and their trends. This information will not be used in connection with \\nany individual human resources management processes. It will not be visible to \\nrecruiters or hiring managers in recruitment, selection or promotion processes, or to \\nmanagers in the performance management, retention or separation processes. A \\ncomprehensive racial diversity baseline report will be produced with the aim of \\nidentifying patterns of systemic institutional racial bias across the Secretariat. To \\nencourage staff to disclose their racial identities, the Anti-Racism Office is \\nproactively developing an internal communications campaign in collaboration with \\nthe Department of Global Communications to build trust and encourage participation. \\n \\n \\n \\nC. Accountability and racial justice  \\n \\n \\n44. The work under this pillar is focused on developing measures to address racism \\nand racial discrimination and ensure accountability from both leadership and staff. It \\nalso addresses issues related to the internal administration of justice system, aiming \\nto promote racial justice and fostering a safe institutional environment for making \\ncomplaints and reporting incidents of racism. Racial healing and protection and \\nsupport mechanisms for staff members affected by racial discrimination are also \\ncritical aspects of this pillar. \\n45. The review of Secretary-General’s bulletin ST/SGB/2019/8 to include a \\ndefinition of racial discrimination as prohibited conduct for all staff is being \\nundertaken by the Anti-Racism Office in collaboration with the Office of Human \\nResources, OIOS, the Office of Legal Affairs and other key stakeholders. Proposed \\namendments to the bulletin went through an entity-wide consultation process prior to \\nfurther review. To support the review, the Anti-Racism Office conducted research on \\ndefinitions used by other United Nations agencies and multilateral institutions. This \\nresearch contributed to framing the discussions between stakeholders and highlighted \\nthat, once the revised ST/SGB/2019/8 is promulgated, the Anti-Racism Office is to \\ndevelop, in consultation with key stakeholders, an accompanying guideline to assist \\nwith providing examples of racial discrimination. \\n46. Regarding data on complaints including elements of racism and racial discrimination, \\nOIOS received 132 such complaints from 30 September 2023 to 30 September 2025. Of \\nthe 132 complaints, 38 were decided for investigation by OIOS, 61 were referred to the \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469 \\n \\n25-20593\\n14/16 \\n \\nrelevant responsible official for review and appropriate action, 32 were closed, and \\n1 remained in intake. During the same period, 37 investigations were completed. The \\nnumber of complaints received remained relatively stable over the two-year period, \\nalthough a spike in reporting was observed in the last quarter of 2024, bringing the total \\nnumber of complaints for 2024 to a record high of 81. This increase was observed in the \\nmonths following online events on accountability organized by the Anti-Racism Office. \\nBetween 1 January and 30 September 2025, 46 complaints were received. Meanwhile, the \\naverage time to complete investigations improved during the two-year period, from 12.5 \\nmonths to 10.9 months, which is lower than the overall average completion time for all \\ntypes of misconduct. OIOS also organized training for its investigators to sensitize them to \\nhow racism manifests itself and on how racism may best be investigated. \\n47. To reinforce a system-wide zero-tolerance policy on racism, the Office of \\nAdministration of Justice, through the Caselaw portal for United Nations Dispute \\nTribunal and United Nations Appeals Tribunal judgments, makes a search available \\nfor the category “Discrimination and other improper motives” and the subcategory \\n“Race”. A search for the term “racism” reveals that 35 judgments from both Tribunals \\nreferred to racism in the context of the parties’ submissions and/or in the Tribunal’s \\nconsiderations. This does not necessarily mean that the Tribunals identified racism as \\na motive of discrimination, but that reference was made to racism in the judgments. \\n48. The Office of Staff Legal Assistance collected data on cases involving allegations \\nof racism, having received 33 such cases between 1 December 2024 and 25 September \\n2025. Furthermore, the Office successfully represented a staff member in a non-selection \\ncase that raised several issues, including issues relating to racial bias, and the Appeals \\nTribunal ultimately found in favour of the staff member, due to a number of factors. \\n49. In 2024, the Administrative Law Division of the Office of Human Resources started \\ntracking cases in which the established misconduct related to race, nationality or ethnic \\norigin. In 2024, three cases involving racist or racially insensitive behaviour warranted \\nseparation from service, and one case resulted in a written censure. In addition, and as \\npart of an expansion of the ClearCheck system, the Division included “racism and racial \\ndiscrimination” in the ClearCheck database as a type of misconduct warranting an end to \\na working relationship with the United Nations. As at 1 November 2025, 30 participating \\nUnited Nations entities had joined ClearCheck 2.0. As at the same date, the ClearCheck \\ndatabase contained the name and related information of one individual who had been \\nsubject to a substantiated allegation of racism and racial discrimination. \\n50. As the informal part of the system of administration of justice, the Office of the \\nUnited Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services is available to personnel who \\nhave concerns related to prohibited conduct, including racial discrimination, under \\nSecretary-General’s bulletin ST/SGB/2019/8. Under the zero-tolerance approach, \\nmost cases related to allegations of racial discrimination are directed to the formal \\ncomplaints channel; nevertheless, some employees have turned to the Office after \\nexperiencing racial discrimination and/or racist behaviour motivated by conscious or \\nunconscious beliefs and biases. In such cases, the Office seeks to facilitate \\nconversations to enhance understanding and awareness, leading to reflection and \\nbehavioural change by the alleged offenders.  \\n51. In carrying out its advisory function, the Ethics Office advocates against racism \\nand racial discrimination through its advisory and outreach activities at duty stations \\nand locations across the global Secretariat. Furthermore, the Office’s mandate of \\nimplementing the Organization’s policy on protection against retaliation also \\nencourages staff to speak up, with the aim of protecting staff who report misconduct \\nwithin the parameters of the policy. \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469\\n \\n15/16\\n25-20593 \\n \\n \\nIV. Main challenges and the way forward \\n \\n \\n52. The Anti-Racism Office continues to face several constraints that affect the scope \\nand pace of its work, necessitating strategic adjustments. Despite the progress achieved \\nin 2024 and 2025, persistent liquidity constraints have challenged the Office’s capacity \\nto work more effectively. Given the small size of the Office, its operational success in \\ncarrying out this large and vital mandate benefits much from the performance of the \\nanti-racism advocates situated across various entities. However, the performance of \\nthis network of advocates remains quite uneven. Although some advocates are \\nperforming very well, a significant number still encounter difficulties in securing \\nleadership support and fully understanding the mandate and at times are overwhelmed \\nby the sheer magnitude and complexity of the task, which they undertake in addition \\nto their regular responsibilities. Convening the advocates every two years in in-person \\ngatherings will be important. The conference in Lisbon proved instrumental in \\nsuccessfully energizing and cultivating a cohesive community among the advocates, \\nenabling open discussions about challenges, lessons learned and best practices. \\nHowever, organizing future gatherings of this nature poses a challenge because they \\nrequire external funding. In that regard, the Secretary-General welcomes voluntary \\ncontributions from Member States to organize the next United Nations Conference on \\nAddressing Racism and Promoting Dignity for All at the Secretariat. \\n53. A fundamental requisite for understanding and addressing systemic and \\nstructural racism within the Secretariat is the collection and analysis of race data from \\nstaff, affiliate personnel and job applicants. Although such data will be strictly \\nanonymized and will not be used in connection with any individual human resources \\nmanagement processes, the Office anticipates some hesitance to participate on the \\npart of those being asked to submit data, due to insufficient understanding of the \\ndata’s intended use. Resources are required to explain this aspect as widely as \\npossible. Since this exercise will be voluntary, staff and applicants must feel a high \\ndegree of comfort and trust to share their racial identities. Insufficient participation \\nwill severely hinder proper scientific analysis, preventing the identification of \\nsystemic inequities.  \\n54. Talking about racism involves inherent sensitivities, and staff have consistently \\nexpressed appreciation for the in-person engagement with the Special Adviser, the \\nAnti-Racism Office and anti-racism advocates as they provide critical spaces for open \\ndialogue and trust-building. In that regard, investing in such in-person engagement \\nwherever possible will be important. \\n55. Looking ahead, the Anti-Racism Office is planning its next phase of work, \\nfocused on ongoing concrete implementation of the strategic action plan and capacity-\\nbuilding. It plans to continue working closely with the anti-racism advocates and \\nother key stakeholders to execute its refined implementation timeline for the next \\nthree years. This timeline details specific actions that have been thoroughly discussed \\nand agreed upon with partners, ensuring that they are implementable, barring any \\nunforeseen circumstances. \\n56. A major future effort will be dedicated to strengthening the capacity of the \\nadvocates to discharge their functions effectively. This focus is based on the \\nunderstanding that effective and sustainable institutional transformation must be \\ngrounded in bottom-up initiatives and local ownership. Another critical area of \\nintervention will be reducing racial bias in recruitment and staff management \\nprocesses. This will require working more effectively with the Office of Human \\nResources and the Department of Operational Support to review policies and practices. \\nSimilarly, reinforcing leadership accountability and ensuring the provision of safe \\nenvironments for staff to lodge complaints and report racist incidents will be vital. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/80/469 \\n \\n25-20593\\n16/16 \\n \\nCrucially, under this pillar, faster resolution of cases must also be prioritized. To \\nachieve this, engagement with OIOS, the Administrative Law Division of the Office \\nof Human Resources and the Office of Administration of Justice will be fundamental. \\n57. The successful execution of the strategic action plan ultimately hinges on a \\nsustained, visible commitment from all levels of the Secretariat, particularly senior \\nleadership. By investing in the dedicated anti-racism advocates, enhancing \\ntransparency with objective data analysis, and ensuring robust accountability \\nmechanisms, the Anti-Racism Office can spearhead the necessary systemic \\ntransformation. The path forward requires collective responsibility to foster an \\norganizational culture free of racial discrimination, where dignity and respect are \\nlived realities for every staff member. \\n \\n \\n \\nV. Action to be taken by the General Assembly \\n \\n \\n58. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the present report. \\n \\n\"}"

Introduction \n \n \n1. \nRacism is fundamentally a system of power based on the false notion of racial \nhierarchies and woven into the fabric of societies and institutions to justify the \nsubjugation of people of colour. It is deeply rooted in the transatlantic trade in \nenslaved Africans, colonialism and apartheid. It is a system used to justify the unequal \ndistribution of power and privilege. This historical legacy continues to have an impact \non societies today with ongoing, detrimental consequences for racialized \ncommunities, which remain subjected to pervasive inequities in areas such as \neducation, healthcare, employment, justice and wealth. \n2. \nAddressing racism transcends managing individual incidents and requires a \ncomprehensive approach to dismantle its historical and systemic roots. In that regard, \nthe approach adopted by the Anti-Racism Office is to focus on the future, recognizing \nthat no one is born a racist and that racism is a social construct that can, with great \neffort, be eliminated. \n3. \nThe presence of racism and racial discrimination in the United Nations system \nundermines the Organization’s standing as a global standard-bearer of human rights. \nMost importantly, racism and racial discrimination debase the Organization’s most \nvaluable asset, its staff, thus negatively affecting the effective discharge of its \nmandates. As the world’s premier intergovernmental organization, the United Nations \nis uniquely placed to demonstrate that workplaces with racially inclusive policies that \nrespect the dignity of all are better equipped to deliver on global mandates geared \ntowards diverse situations and peoples.  \n4. \nOver the years, the Secretariat has made efforts to examine and combat racism and \nracial discrimination following General Assembly resolutions 31/26, 53/221 and 76/271. \nHowever, findings from the 2020 United Nations survey on racism presented in the report \nof the Secretary-General’s Task Force on Addressing Racism and Promoting Dignity for \nAll in the United Nations Secretariat confirmed the continued presence of racism and \nracial discrimination within the Organization. Pursuant to Assembly resolution 76/271, \nin 2022 the Secretariat initiated the implementation of the strategic action plan on \naddressing racism and promoting dignity for all in the United Nations Secretariat. \n5. \nFollowing General Assembly resolution 78/253, the Anti-Racism Office was \nestablished in the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance to \nspearhead and oversee the implementation of the strategic action plan, with its sole \nfocus being to address racism and racial discrimination in the workplace. The Office \noperates under the substantive guidance of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\nGeneral for Addressing Racism in the Workplace and the managerial oversight of the \nUnder-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. The \nImplementation Steering Group, created in 2022 to oversee the operationalization, \nimplementation and mainstreaming of the strategic action plan, continues to provide \noverall leadership and guidance to those charged with the plan’s implementation, in \naddition to providing regular progress reports to the Secretary-General. \n6. \nTo ensure the integration and mainstreaming of anti-racism activities throughout \nthe Organization, the Anti-Racism Office established a network of anti-racism \nadvocates located in duty stations across the global Secretariat, who are the drivers of \nchange at the entity level. The Office also collaborates with key departments and \noffices in the Secretariat, such as the Office of Human Resources, the Office of Support \nOperations, the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services, the \nOffice of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and the Office of Administration of \nJustice, to examine and reformulate policies, practices and norms that may hinder \nracial diversity and dignity for all. Moreover, close engagement with staff unions and \naffinity groups, as well as United Nations system-wide entities, allows the \nAnti-Racism Office to exchange information on best practices and lessons learned.  \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469 \n \n25-20593\n4/16 \n \n \nII. The imperative to address racism and racial discrimination \n \n \n7. \nIn 2021, the Secretary-General issued the report on addressing racism and \npromoting dignity for all in the United Nations Secretariat and its corresponding strategic \naction plan. The need to address racism and racial discrimination was also underscored \nby the Joint Inspection Unit in its note entitled “Review of measures and mechanisms for \naddressing racism and racial discrimination in United Nations system organizations: \nmanaging for achieving organizational effectiveness” (JIU/NOTE/2022/1/Rev.1). Staff \nviews expressed through the racism survey undertaken in 2020 and the staff engagement \nsurvey in 2021 confirmed the urgency of combating racism in the Secretariat. \n8. \nToday, the imperative to address racism and racial discrimination in the \nOrganization remains, as attested by: (a) the staff engagement survey conducted in \n2024; (b) the continuing engagements of the Special Adviser with United Nations \nstaff across the Secretariat; and (c) a recent analysis undertaken by the Secretariat of \nthe staff composition between 2023 and 2025.  \n \n \n \nResults of the 2024 staff engagement survey \n \n9. \nSince 2021, the United Nations staff engagement survey has included questions \non racism and racial discrimination. The responses are a key tool to monitor and \nevaluate experiences of discrimination, identify ongoing issues relating to reporting \nmisconduct, and understand whether any progress has been made in addressing racism \nand racial discrimination in the Secretariat. \n10. The 2024 survey showed that racism and racial discrimination remain key focus \nareas for Secretariat staff. The survey garnered a response rate of 42 per cent \n(approximately 15,000 staff members) with staff who self-identified as “Black or \nAfro-descent” and “White” having the highest participation rates. Secretariat staff \nwho responded to the staff engagement survey self-identified as follows:  \n \nCategory \nNumber \nPercentage \nBlack or Afro-descent \n3 390 \n24 \nCentral Asian \n356 \n2 \nEast Asian \n573 \n4 \nLatino/a or Hispanic \n1 085 \n8 \nMultiracial \n558 \n4 \nNorth African/Middle Eastern \n933 \n7 \nNot listed \n640 \n4 \nPrefer not to disclose \n1 723 \n12 \nSouth Asian \n637 \n4 \nSouth-East Asian \n629 \n4 \nWhite \n3 763 \n26 \nTotal \n14 287 \n100 \n \n \n11. \nQuestions in the staff engagement survey relating to racism and racial \ndiscrimination addressed issues such as tolerance of racial discrimination in the \nworkplace, leadership commitment to addressing racism and racial discrimination, \nimpact of training programmes, and understanding of where to report racism and \nracial discrimination. Survey respondents who reported having been discriminated \nagainst were asked further questions on how they responded to the discrimination, \nwhether they had reported it, and satisfaction with how reports were handled. \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469\n \n5/16\n25-20593 \n \n12. The 2024 survey results demonstrated that racism and discrimination continue \nto be prevalent concerns for Secretariat staff. Results remained largely consistent with \ntrends measured by previous staff engagement surveys starting in 2021. Twenty-five \nper cent of respondents in 2024 felt that they were not guaranteed equal opportunities \nat work due to a number of factors, including race, skin colour and national or ethnic \norigin. Findings also showed that 33 per cent of those respondents who reported that \nthey had been discriminated against indicated that critical incidents or misconduct \nwere not reported due to a lack of trust in the reporting system, with 48 per cent \nindicating a fear of retaliation. Over half of respondents who indicated that they had \nreported cases expressed dissatisfaction with how incidents were resolved. \n13. The results of the 2024 staff engagement survey demonstrate the need for \ncontinued engagement with staff and stakeholders on all three pillars of the work of \nthe Anti-Racism Office (advocacy and awareness-raising, transparency and \ninstitutional reform, and accountability and racial justice) to improve perceptions and \nexperiences related to racism and racial discrimination in the Secretariat.  \n \n \n \nSpecial Adviser’s engagement with staff and the United Nations system \n \n14. To advance the strategic action plan and directly engage with United Nations \nstaff and leadership in the field, the Special Adviser undertook a mission to Ethiopia, \nKenya and Somalia from 28 April to 6 May 2025. The mission was aimed at evaluating \nprogress in implementing the strategic action plan and better understanding staff \nexperiences and perceptions of racism in the workplace. It included engagements with \npersonnel in the Economic Commission for Africa, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the \nUnited Nations Office at Nairobi, the United Nations Support Office in Somalia and \nthe United Nations Transitional Assistance Mission in Somalia. \n15. During these engagements, staff members raised several issues, pointing to \nstructural disparities across various recruitment and human resources management \npractices, as well as incidents of overt racist behaviour in the workplace which have \nled to significant mental health issues. A prevalent fear of retaliation still prevents \nmany from coming forward to report incidents of racial discrimination. More broadly, \nstaff members relayed fear and uncertainty about the impact of UN80 reforms on \nthem, which might have a disproportional impact on people of colour. In response, \nthe Special Adviser reiterated that, as the Organization underwent restructuring, it \nmust be highly aware of and actively guard against reproducing old racial hierarchies. \nUltimately, the success of this reform hinged on its ability to decisively correct \nhistorical exclusions, rather than inadvertently entrench them.  \n16. Specific concerns raised by staff included stalled implementation of the strategic \naction plan and marginalization in relation to mobility and access to global roles. Staff \nhave spoken openly – often identifying themselves – about racial bias in deployment \nand promotion, lack of inclusive leadership development, exclusion of General \nService staff and contractors from anti-racism efforts, and fears that UN80 reforms \ncould reverse recent gains. Some staff felt that training and travel opportunities were \nalso clouded by perceptions of racial bias. On a positive note, one anti-racism \nadvocate created the Supporting Holistic Anti-Racism Efforts (SHARE) Team, which \nwas recognized as a model to be replicated in other entities. \n17. The Special Adviser also convened hybrid town hall meetings that reached \npersonnel in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the Department of \nManagement Strategy, Policy and Compliance, the Department of Peace Operations, \nthe Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, the Department for General \nAssembly and Conference Management, the Department of Global Communications, \nthe Department of Safety and Security and the Development Coordination Office. The \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469 \n \n25-20593\n6/16 \n \nSpecial Adviser also held virtual town hall meetings for the United Nations Assistance \nMission in Afghanistan and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. At these \nmeetings, concerns raised by staff included subtle but entrenched racism in \nrecruitment and daily interactions, denial of racism by some managers, burden-of-\nproof challenges, exclusion of national staff perspectives, elitism favouring graduates \nof prestigious global North universities, and tokenistic implementation of diversity \nmeasures. At one such meeting, specific allegations of racism were raised openly \nagainst a manager who was in the room. \n18. Across all duty stations, staff consistently requested stronger accountability \nmechanisms. They also directed complaints and reported racism to the Special \nAdviser and occasionally to the Anti-Racism Office, despite neither being mandated \nto process them. Submissions included allegations of racial discrimination in the \nworkplace and racial bias in appointments and promotions, and, where appropriate, \nformal complaints were shared with OIOS for proper follow-up and investigation. \nHowever, in many instances staff members just wanted to share their experiences and \nrefused to lodge formal complaints due to a lack of trust in the system of \nadministration of justice and fear of potential reprisals.  \n19. \nBeyond the Secretariat, the Special Adviser delivered a presentation to the United \nNations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination in Santiago in May 2024, \nhighlighting the urgency of addressing racism across the United Nations system and of \npromoting a coordinated response. She further engaged with agencies, funds and \nprogrammes through the Geneva Alliance against Racism and participated in the senior \nwomen’s leadership retreats organized by the Deputy Secretary-General, to advance \ndiscussions on inclusive leadership and accountability. The Special Adviser also met \nwith heads of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes based in East Africa \nduring her visit to Nairobi. In addition, the Special Adviser’s team gave briefings on \nthe work of the Anti-Racism Office at multiple orientation programmes organized by \nthe United Nations System Staff College for Junior Professional Officers across the \nUnited Nations system.  \n \n \n \nAnalysis of recent staff composition \n \n20. In the absence of race-related data in the Organization’s enterprise systems, \ngeographical regions of Member States are used as a proxy. It is crucial to \nacknowledge that geographical regions of Member States as a proxy for race-related \ndata do not provide a full understanding of racial identity. It is also understood that \ngeographical regions are not homogeneous and exhibit a degree of racial diversity. \nWhile the data analysis does not directly measure the impact of systemic and \nstructural racism on the Organization’s recruitment policies, processes and \nprocedures, it does offer valuable indicative evidence regarding the application of the \nstaff selection system based on geographical regions of Member States. The analysis \nfollows a similar approach to that in the reports of the Secretary-General on the \ncomposition of the Secretariat: staff demographics. \n21. \nTo implement its mandates, the Secretariat relied on a workforce of 35,231 as at \n31 December 2024, including 881 staff who supplemented the workforce with \ntemporary assistance for meetings, staff on when-actually-employed contracts and staff \nwith one-dollar-per-year contracts. Among those staff members, 41 per cent are serving \nin the Professional and higher categories. Figure I shows the regional distribution of \nstaff employed in the Secretariat in the Professional and higher categories.  \n \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469\n \n7/16\n25-20593 \n \n \n \nFigure I \n \n \nSecretariat staff in the Professional and higher categories, by geographical region \nof Member States, as at 31 December 2024 \n(Number and percentage) \n(Population: 13,585 staff)a \n \n \n \n \n \na Excludes 881 staff who supplement the workforce with temporary assistance for meetings, \nstaff on when-actually-employed contracts and staff with one-dollar-per-year contracts. \n \n \n22. Table 1 reveals disparities, showing that not all groups have the same share of \ndecision-making roles (P-5, D-1, D-2) that they do of the Professional and higher \ncategories as a whole. Specifically, the share of decision-making roles is lower for \nAfricans and Asians and higher for staff from the Americas, Europe and Oceania. \n \nTable 1 \nSummary of staff members, appointments and promotions in the Professional and higher categories, by \ngeographical region \n(Number and percentage) \n \n \nAfrica \n \nAmericas \n \nAsia \n \nEurope \n \nOceania \n \nNumber Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage \nTotal \nStaff in the Professional and \nhigher categories \n2 889 \n21.3 \n2 681 \n19.7 \n2 790 \n20.5 \n4 924 \n36.2 \n301 \n2.2 13 585 \nStaff at the P-5, D-1 and D-2 \nlevels  \n541 \n20.0 \n551 \n20.4 \n478 \n17.7 \n1 041 \n38.6 \n89 \n3.3 \n2 700 \nAppointments at the P-5, D-1 \nand D-2 levels \n205 \n25.0 \n166 \n20.3 \n144 \n17.6 \n278 \n33.9 \n26 \n3.2 \n819 \nPromotions at the P-5, D-1 \nand D-2 levels \n205 \n21.4 \n200 \n20.9 \n163 \n17.1 \n361 \n37.8 \n27 \n2.8 \n956 \n \nNote: Staff population as at 31 December 2024, excluding staff who supplemented the workforce with temporary assistance for \nmeetings, staff on when-actually-employed contracts and staff with one-dollar-per-year contracts.

Regarding trends observed relating to applications for positions and selection \ntrends in recruitment processes, an analysis was conducted of the number of \napplicants from various geographical regions and selection outcomes for job openings \nin the Professional and higher categories across all entities within the Secretariat, \nincluding peacekeeping operations, special political missions, other political \npresences, departments/offices, regional commissions and tribunals. \n24.

Activities undertaken to address racism and racial \ndiscrimination in the United Nations Secretariat \n \n \n27. The Secretary-General’s strategic action plan on addressing racism and \npromoting dignity for all in the United Nations Secretariat is the road map for targeted \nactions to combat racism and racial discrimination at the interpersonal, institutional, \nstructural and systemic levels. The Anti-Racism Office has been spearheading the \nimplementation of the strategic action plan using resources approved by the General \nAssembly in its resolution 78/253. \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469 \n \n25-20593\n10/16 \n \n28. The Anti-Racism Office continued to implement the strategic action plan through \nits three-pronged approach, consisting of the following action pillars: advocacy and \nawareness-raising; transparency and institutional reform; and accountability and racial \njustice. The Office undertook its activities in collaboration with anti-racism advocates \nand relevant partners across the Secretariat. To promote engagement, coordination and \ncomplementarity and to prevent duplication, the Office convenes several recurring \nmeetings: quarterly meetings with anti-racism advocates, principals of relevant \nentities involved in implementing the strategic action plan, and working-level, \nthematic working groups tied to the three aforementioned action pillars; biannual \nmeetings with staff unions, national staff associations, and staff affinity groups such \nas the United Nations People of African Descent and the United Nations Asia Network \nfor Diversity and Inclusion; and an annual retreat that brings together all designated \nactors from various entities involved in the implementation of this mandate. In \naddition, the Special Adviser annually convenes and chairs three meetings of the \nImplementation Steering Group, which is composed of senior United Nations leaders \nand external experts and provides high-level guidance for the activities of the \nAnti-Racism Office and its partners across the Secretariat. All these meetings provide \nstructured frameworks for multiple stakeholders to discuss, build and coordinate \nsynergies towards the effective implementation of the strategic action plan.  \n29. As requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 78/253, the Anti-Racism \nOffice has refined the strategic action plan. This refinement does not aim to replace \nthe existing action plan but rather to provide an update focused on three key areas: \n \n• Ensuring that the plan is focused exclusively on addressing racism and racial \ndiscrimination \n \n• Updating the definitions of critical concepts related to racism and racial \ndiscrimination to account for evolving understandings \n \n• Including additional implementation actions \nThe refinement of the strategic action plan was undertaken through a consultative \nprocess with the anti-racism advocates and other relevant stakeholders in the Secretariat. \n30. The activities undertaken by the Anti-Racism Office in collaboration with its \npartners in the Secretariat and the broader United Nations system during the reporting \nperiod are presented below under headings corresponding to the three action pillars. \n \n \n \nA. Advocacy and awareness-raising \n \n \n31. \nThrough activities aimed at raising awareness about racism and racial \ndiscrimination, as well as fostering dialogue and learning, the work under this pillar is \nfocused on changing the organizational culture and building a workplace free of racism. \n32. In terms of training, the Anti-Racism Office, in collaboration with the Office of \nHuman Resources, finalized the Secretariat’s first ever course on racism, entitled \n“Addressing racism and racial discrimination in the workplace”, which was launched \non 4 December 2025 in English and French, with other official languages to follow. \nThis online self-paced basic awareness course is intended to be made mandatory for \nall personnel.  \n33. The Anti-Racism Office also organized, in collaboration with an external \nconsultancy firm, various anti-racism training programmes in 2023, 2024 and 2025. \nThese were directed at specialized groups such as the anti-racism advocates, senior \nleaders, managers at the D-1 and D-2 levels, staff counsellors, conduct and discipline \nofficers, investigators, human resources chiefs, legal officers and members of the \nOffice of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services. Topics included \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469\n \n11/16\n25-20593 \n \nfoundational anti-racism skills, psychological safety, the role of the United Nations \nin addressing racism, anti-racism leadership, anti-racism allyship, and racial healing. \nParticipants were also trained on how to facilitate difficult discussions and foster \nconstructive dialogue. These training courses were taken by 531 participants, \nincluding 79 at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General levels \nand additional colleagues from the wider United Nations system.  \n34. Meanwhile, in 2025 the Department of Operational Support launched a course \nentitled “Brave conversations: building thriving teams together”, which contained \nanti-racism elements and was accompanied by an interactive card exercise designed \nto spark open dialogue, critical thinking and meaningful reflections around the \nconcept of psychological safety. The Department also published an updated and \nenhanced version of “The art of hiring talent”, incorporating recommendations and \nbest practices from the Anti-Racism Office on staff selection.  \n35. Regarding the creation of spaces and platforms for staff to share experiences, ask \nquestions and contribute to shaping the Organization’s anti-racism agenda, the \nAnti-Racism Office organized 10 advocacy and awareness-raising events, including \nthe “United against racism” live talks and anti-racism conversations. Topics included \naddressing racial bias, reporting racism complaints, promoting upstanding and allyship \nand decolonizing minds. During these events, the Anti-Racism Office engaged a range \nof distinguished external speakers who interacted directly with staff and responded to \ntheir questions, fostering deeper reflection on racism, identity and justice across the \nUnited Nations. Among them were Djamila Ribeiro (Brazil), philosopher, writer and \nactivist; Trevor Manuel (South Africa), former minister; Mamadou Diouf (Senegal), \nhistorian at Columbia University; Gay McDougall (United States of America), \nmember of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; Constance \nMayer (United States of America), Chief of Diversity and Inclusion at the Department \nof State; Afua Hirsch (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), \njournalist, author and broadcaster; Albie Sachs (South Africa), former judge of the \nConstitutional Court; and Penelope Andrews (South Africa), law professor and \nDirector of New York Law School’s Racial Justice Project. These sessions reached \nover 27,000 staff members globally and generated more than 4,000 comments and \nquestions. The United against Racism iSeek page and dedicated UN Web TV channel \nreceived more than 12,000 visits, demonstrating sustained staff interest. \n36. The United Nations anti-racism advocates are the drivers of the implementation \nof the strategic action plan at the entity level. During the reporting period, the \nAnti-Racism Office expanded this global network, which now includes 146 \nanti-racism advocates and alternates as well as over 75 working group members \nserving across 85 Secretariat entities worldwide. To strengthen their capacity, the \nAnti-Racism Office works closely with the network, providing the advocates with \ntraining, an online resource hub and a platform for internal communication.  \n37. Across duty stations, the anti-racism advocates organized a variety of activities. \nFor example, in Mogadishu, they organized an anti-racism retreat and a series of staff \ndiscussions, established a library of anti-racism literature to foster learning and worked \nwith leadership to establish measures for anti-racism accountability. In Entebbe, \nUganda, advocates organized film screenings followed by discussions to raise \nawareness. In Geneva, in addition to entity-focused training and discussions, they \norganized an anti-racism-focused picnic for staff to support each other. In Naqurah, \nLebanon, the advocates formed dedicated working groups of staff volunteers who \norganized regular dialogues on anti-racism. Meanwhile, the anti-racism working group \nin Vienna was instrumental in constituting peer support groups for colleagues who \nexperience racial discrimination. Other advocates incorporated anti-racism into \ninduction training, conducted internal surveys to assess staff perceptions of racism, \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469 \n \n25-20593\n12/16 \n \ncreated podcasts, produced articles to raise awareness about racism in the workplace, \nand worked closely with their senior leaders to develop entity-specific action plans. A \nmajor task being undertaken by the advocates is the Diversity in Leadership \nTransparency Project, which entails the publication of the names, photos, nationalities, \nlevels and titles of all senior leaders at the D-1 level and above. As of November 2025, \n50 per cent of the 85 entities have completed the project. Overall, despite all the \nchallenges they face, the anti-racism advocates have consistently served as the \nbackbone for implementing the strategic action plan within their respective entities. \n38. The Anti-Racism Office hosted the United Nations Conference on Addressing \nRacism and Promoting Dignity for All at the Secretariat in Lisbon from 9 to 12 June \n2025. The conference was made possible through the support of the Government of \nPortugal and an additional contribution from the Government of the United Kingdom \nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The conference brought together 50 \nparticipants from duty stations across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle \nEast and North America, the majority of whom were anti-racism advocates. The \nconference was aimed at sharing information and fostering a cohesive anti-racism \ncommunity with a common vision to accelerate the implementation of the strategic \naction plan. Participants had the opportunity to engage with guest speakers from the \nhost country, South Africa and the United Kingdom from sectors as diverse as \ngovernment, civil society, academia, corporate business and the arts. The discussions \ncovered topics such as the systemic and historical nature of racism; racial bias in \nrecruitment and staff management processes; accountability and racial justice; \ncollection and analysis of race data; and mediation support and anti-retaliation \nmechanisms. Tangible outcomes included a clear implementation timeline for \nactivities in 2026–2028; a robust engagement strategy for anti-racism stakeholders \nacross the Secretariat; the approval of a toolkit for anti-racism advocates entitled \n“Facilitating discussions on race, racism and racial discrimination in the workplace”; \nand a symbolic pledge to combat racism and racial discrimination in the Secretariat \nthat was signed by all participants.  \n \n \n \nB. Transparency and institutional reform  \n \n \n39. The work under this pillar is focused on collecting and analysing data to \nunderstand the racial composition of the Secretariat's workforce and applicant pool \nand examine potential bias in recruitment, appointments, promotions, mobility, roster \nmanagement and career satisfaction opportunities. This pillar also addresses the \nreview of institutional policies and practices that may appear neutral but could lead \nto racial inequities. The ultimate aim is to identify systemic or institutional \ndiscriminatory provisions and subsequently, where necessary, amend existing policies \nor introduce new ones. \n40. Key stakeholders in this pillar include the Anti-Racism Office, the Department \nof Operational Support and the Office of Human Resources. The Organization, \nfollowing a number of comprehensive reviews on reducing recruitment bias, is \noperationalizing key recommendations. New elements include requiring geographical \ndiversity on interview panels and moving to a new structured interview model under \nthe staff selection system policy effective 1 October 2025. The Department of \nOperational Support is also undertaking measures to reduce bias, including racial \nbias, in the generic rostering process and developing a machine learning framework \nto identify and measure potential bias in recruitment. Furthermore, in June 2025, the \nTalent Finder tool was implemented to proactively enable hiring teams to reach out \nto qualified candidates from unrepresented and underrepresented nationalities.  \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469\n \n13/16\n25-20593 \n \n41. Moreover, the staff selection 2.0 project is implementing key initiatives to \nremove barriers in recruitment and make recruitment more effective, fair, efficient \nand agile. Staff selection 2.0 is expected to have a positive impact in reducing \npotential racial discrimination in recruitment. Initiatives under staff selection 2.0 \ninclude undertaking inclusive job analysis and updating job profiles to provide for \nskills-based recruitment; developing options for assessment methodologies to fulfil \nthe universality objective, including interview methods; professionalizing recruiters; \nand enhancing data capabilities to allow real-time monitoring, with a view to ensuring \nthat the recruitment process is evaluated for fairness and decisions are continuously \nmonitored for potential bias and accuracy, permitting evidence-informed adjustments.  \n42. Regarding data collection and analysis, and in response to the General \nAssembly’s request in resolution 78/253, the Anti-Racism Office, in collaboration \nwith the Department of Operational Support and the Office of Information and \nCommunications Technology, established a framework for the collection of race data \nfrom staff, affiliate personnel and job applicants. The collection of race data is \nexpected to begin via Inspira as early as possible in 2026. \n43. Race data will be provided voluntarily, used in an anonymized and aggregated \nform, kept confidential and used only to understand racism and racial discrimination \nin the Secretariat and to take remedial actions to reverse patterns of racism and racial \ndiscrimination and their trends. This information will not be used in connection with \nany individual human resources management processes. It will not be visible to \nrecruiters or hiring managers in recruitment, selection or promotion processes, or to \nmanagers in the performance management, retention or separation processes. A \ncomprehensive racial diversity baseline report will be produced with the aim of \nidentifying patterns of systemic institutional racial bias across the Secretariat. To \nencourage staff to disclose their racial identities, the Anti-Racism Office is \nproactively developing an internal communications campaign in collaboration with \nthe Department of Global Communications to build trust and encourage participation. \n \n \n \nC. Accountability and racial justice  \n \n \n44. The work under this pillar is focused on developing measures to address racism \nand racial discrimination and ensure accountability from both leadership and staff. It \nalso addresses issues related to the internal administration of justice system, aiming \nto promote racial justice and fostering a safe institutional environment for making \ncomplaints and reporting incidents of racism. Racial healing and protection and \nsupport mechanisms for staff members affected by racial discrimination are also \ncritical aspects of this pillar. \n45. The review of Secretary-General’s bulletin ST/SGB/2019/8 to include a \ndefinition of racial discrimination as prohibited conduct for all staff is being \nundertaken by the Anti-Racism Office in collaboration with the Office of Human \nResources, OIOS, the Office of Legal Affairs and other key stakeholders. Proposed \namendments to the bulletin went through an entity-wide consultation process prior to \nfurther review. To support the review, the Anti-Racism Office conducted research on \ndefinitions used by other United Nations agencies and multilateral institutions. This \nresearch contributed to framing the discussions between stakeholders and highlighted \nthat, once the revised ST/SGB/2019/8 is promulgated, the Anti-Racism Office is to \ndevelop, in consultation with key stakeholders, an accompanying guideline to assist \nwith providing examples of racial discrimination. \n46. Regarding data on complaints including elements of racism and racial discrimination, \nOIOS received 132 such complaints from 30 September 2023 to 30 September 2025. Of \nthe 132 complaints, 38 were decided for investigation by OIOS, 61 were referred to the \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469 \n \n25-20593\n14/16 \n \nrelevant responsible official for review and appropriate action, 32 were closed, and \n1 remained in intake. During the same period, 37 investigations were completed. The \nnumber of complaints received remained relatively stable over the two-year period, \nalthough a spike in reporting was observed in the last quarter of 2024, bringing the total \nnumber of complaints for 2024 to a record high of 81. This increase was observed in the \nmonths following online events on accountability organized by the Anti-Racism Office. \nBetween 1 January and 30 September 2025, 46 complaints were received. Meanwhile, the \naverage time to complete investigations improved during the two-year period, from 12.5 \nmonths to 10.9 months, which is lower than the overall average completion time for all \ntypes of misconduct. OIOS also organized training for its investigators to sensitize them to \nhow racism manifests itself and on how racism may best be investigated. \n47. To reinforce a system-wide zero-tolerance policy on racism, the Office of \nAdministration of Justice, through the Caselaw portal for United Nations Dispute \nTribunal and United Nations Appeals Tribunal judgments, makes a search available \nfor the category “Discrimination and other improper motives” and the subcategory \n“Race”. A search for the term “racism” reveals that 35 judgments from both Tribunals \nreferred to racism in the context of the parties’ submissions and/or in the Tribunal’s \nconsiderations. This does not necessarily mean that the Tribunals identified racism as \na motive of discrimination, but that reference was made to racism in the judgments. \n48. The Office of Staff Legal Assistance collected data on cases involving allegations \nof racism, having received 33 such cases between 1 December 2024 and 25 September \n2025. Furthermore, the Office successfully represented a staff member in a non-selection \ncase that raised several issues, including issues relating to racial bias, and the Appeals \nTribunal ultimately found in favour of the staff member, due to a number of factors. \n49. In 2024, the Administrative Law Division of the Office of Human Resources started \ntracking cases in which the established misconduct related to race, nationality or ethnic \norigin. In 2024, three cases involving racist or racially insensitive behaviour warranted \nseparation from service, and one case resulted in a written censure. In addition, and as \npart of an expansion of the ClearCheck system, the Division included “racism and racial \ndiscrimination” in the ClearCheck database as a type of misconduct warranting an end to \na working relationship with the United Nations. As at 1 November 2025, 30 participating \nUnited Nations entities had joined ClearCheck 2.0. As at the same date, the ClearCheck \ndatabase contained the name and related information of one individual who had been \nsubject to a substantiated allegation of racism and racial discrimination. \n50. As the informal part of the system of administration of justice, the Office of the \nUnited Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services is available to personnel who \nhave concerns related to prohibited conduct, including racial discrimination, under \nSecretary-General’s bulletin ST/SGB/2019/8. Under the zero-tolerance approach, \nmost cases related to allegations of racial discrimination are directed to the formal \ncomplaints channel; nevertheless, some employees have turned to the Office after \nexperiencing racial discrimination and/or racist behaviour motivated by conscious or \nunconscious beliefs and biases. In such cases, the Office seeks to facilitate \nconversations to enhance understanding and awareness, leading to reflection and \nbehavioural change by the alleged offenders.  \n51. In carrying out its advisory function, the Ethics Office advocates against racism \nand racial discrimination through its advisory and outreach activities at duty stations \nand locations across the global Secretariat. Furthermore, the Office’s mandate of \nimplementing the Organization’s policy on protection against retaliation also \nencourages staff to speak up, with the aim of protecting staff who report misconduct \nwithin the parameters of the policy. \n \n \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469\n \n15/16\n25-20593 \n \n \nIV. Main challenges and the way forward \n \n \n52. The Anti-Racism Office continues to face several constraints that affect the scope \nand pace of its work, necessitating strategic adjustments. Despite the progress achieved \nin 2024 and 2025, persistent liquidity constraints have challenged the Office’s capacity \nto work more effectively. Given the small size of the Office, its operational success in \ncarrying out this large and vital mandate benefits much from the performance of the \nanti-racism advocates situated across various entities. However, the performance of \nthis network of advocates remains quite uneven. Although some advocates are \nperforming very well, a significant number still encounter difficulties in securing \nleadership support and fully understanding the mandate and at times are overwhelmed \nby the sheer magnitude and complexity of the task, which they undertake in addition \nto their regular responsibilities. Convening the advocates every two years in in-person \ngatherings will be important. The conference in Lisbon proved instrumental in \nsuccessfully energizing and cultivating a cohesive community among the advocates, \nenabling open discussions about challenges, lessons learned and best practices. \nHowever, organizing future gatherings of this nature poses a challenge because they \nrequire external funding. In that regard, the Secretary-General welcomes voluntary \ncontributions from Member States to organize the next United Nations Conference on \nAddressing Racism and Promoting Dignity for All at the Secretariat. \n53. A fundamental requisite for understanding and addressing systemic and \nstructural racism within the Secretariat is the collection and analysis of race data from \nstaff, affiliate personnel and job applicants. Although such data will be strictly \nanonymized and will not be used in connection with any individual human resources \nmanagement processes, the Office anticipates some hesitance to participate on the \npart of those being asked to submit data, due to insufficient understanding of the \ndata’s intended use. Resources are required to explain this aspect as widely as \npossible. Since this exercise will be voluntary, staff and applicants must feel a high \ndegree of comfort and trust to share their racial identities. Insufficient participation \nwill severely hinder proper scientific analysis, preventing the identification of \nsystemic inequities.  \n54. Talking about racism involves inherent sensitivities, and staff have consistently \nexpressed appreciation for the in-person engagement with the Special Adviser, the \nAnti-Racism Office and anti-racism advocates as they provide critical spaces for open \ndialogue and trust-building. In that regard, investing in such in-person engagement \nwherever possible will be important. \n55. Looking ahead, the Anti-Racism Office is planning its next phase of work, \nfocused on ongoing concrete implementation of the strategic action plan and capacity-\nbuilding. It plans to continue working closely with the anti-racism advocates and \nother key stakeholders to execute its refined implementation timeline for the next \nthree years. This timeline details specific actions that have been thoroughly discussed \nand agreed upon with partners, ensuring that they are implementable, barring any \nunforeseen circumstances. \n56. A major future effort will be dedicated to strengthening the capacity of the \nadvocates to discharge their functions effectively. This focus is based on the \nunderstanding that effective and sustainable institutional transformation must be \ngrounded in bottom-up initiatives and local ownership. Another critical area of \nintervention will be reducing racial bias in recruitment and staff management \nprocesses. This will require working more effectively with the Office of Human \nResources and the Department of Operational Support to review policies and practices. \nSimilarly, reinforcing leadership accountability and ensuring the provision of safe \nenvironments for staff to lodge complaints and report racist incidents will be vital. \n\n\n---\n\nA/80/469 \n \n25-20593\n16/16 \n \nCrucially, under this pillar, faster resolution of cases must also be prioritized. To \nachieve this, engagement with OIOS, the Administrative Law Division of the Office \nof Human Resources and the Office of Administration of Justice will be fundamental. \n57. The successful execution of the strategic action plan ultimately hinges on a \nsustained, visible commitment from all levels of the Secretariat, particularly senior \nleadership. By investing in the dedicated anti-racism advocates, enhancing \ntransparency with objective data analysis, and ensuring robust accountability \nmechanisms, the Anti-Racism Office can spearhead the necessary systemic \ntransformation. The path forward requires collective responsibility to foster an \norganizational culture free of racial discrimination, where dignity and respect are \nlived realities for every staff member. \n \n \n \nV. Action to be taken by the General Assembly \n \n \n58. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the present report. \n \n"

Introduction  \\n \\n \\n1. \\nThe present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/126 \\nand provides an update on the implementation of the resolution from 1 June 2022 to \\n31 May 2023. It is based on direct monitoring and information-gathering conducted \\nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) \\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and on information provided by Government \\nsources, United Nations entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The \\nreport should be read in conjunction with related reports of the Secretary-General and \\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted to the General \\nAssembly and the Human Rights Council.1 \\n2. \\nThe report contains an update on settlement advancement and its impact on the \\nhuman rights of the Palestinian people. Section IV highlights settlement expansion \\nand settler violence as key human rights violations against Palestinians in the West \\nBank, with a focus on the Nablus area. It also contains an update on Israeli settlements \\nin the occupied Syrian Golan. \\n \\n \\n \\nII. Legal background \\n \\n \\n3. \\nBoth international human rights law and international humanitarian law \\nconcurrently apply in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, namely, Gaza and the West \\nBank, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. This includes the \\napplication of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons \\nin Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention), which is binding upon Israel as the \\noccupying Power. A detailed analysis of the applicable legal framework can be found \\nin previous reports of the Secretary-General.2 \\n \\n \\n \\nIII. Update on settlement activities \\n \\n \\n4. \\nOver the past decade, successive Israeli Governments have consistently \\nadvanced and implemented policies of settlement expansion and takeover of \\nPalestinian land.3 \\n5. \\nThe policies of the current Government in this regard are aligned, to an \\nunprecedented extent, with the goals of the Israeli settler movement to expand long-\\nterm control over the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and, in practice, \\nto further integrate those areas into the territory of the State of Israel. The \\nGovernment, in its guiding principles, expressly claimed the “exclusive and \\nindisputable right” of the Jewish people to “all parts of the Land of Israel”, including \\nthe occupied West Bank and the occupied Syrian Golan. 4 In addition, Coalition \\nagreements indicated that the Government would promote a policy of “application of \\nsovereignty” over the West Bank 5  through institutional changes, legislation and \\nmassive settlement expansion, including the regularization of outposts. 6 Any acts or \\npolicies amounting to a purported annexation of the occupied territories, if \\n__________________ \\n \\n1  See A/78/502; A/HRC/52/75; and A/HRC/52/76. \\n \\n2  See A/HRC/34/38; and A/HRC/34/39. \\n \\n3  A/HRC/52/76, para. 2. \\n \\n4 See Government of Israel coalition agreements, on file with the Office of the United Nations \\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). \\n \\n5  See article 118 of the coalition agreement between the Prime Minister and the Religious Zionism \\nparty, on file with OHCHR.  \\n \\n6  Ibid., see for example, arts. 142–199. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554\\n \\n3/20\\n23-20717 \\n \\nimplemented, would constitute a most serious violation of international law, including \\nthe Charter of the United Nations.7 \\n6. \\nBy 31 May, the agenda of the Government was advancing at a fast pace. Ahead \\nof the formation of the Government, the Knesset amended the Basic Law: the \\nGovernment so as to allow the creation of an Additional Minister post within the \\nMinistry of Defence.8 The founder of the settler organization Regavim and leader of \\nthe far-right Religious Zionism party, who resides in the settlement of Kedumim, was \\nappointed as Additional Minister. 9 While the Minister of Defence retains security \\npowers, the Additional Minister, formally under the supervision of the Minister of \\nDefence, assumes administrative functions pertaining to the majority of the governing \\npowers in the West Bank, including land designations, planning and coordination of \\ndemolitions.10 Among other responsibilities, the Additional Minister will supervise a \\nnewly created and staffed Settlement Administration unit 11  and be in charge of \\nmanaging and directing the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories \\nunit and the Civil Administration of Israel; regularizing settlements; implementing an \\n“equal citizenship reform” in the West Bank aimed at improving services and \\ninfrastructure for settlers only; and updating “security legislation”, that is to say, \\nimplementing the reform through military orders. 12  On 18 May, the Additional \\nMinister, in his other capacity as Minister of Finance, reportedly presented to \\nGovernment ministries a two-year plan under which 500,000 more settlers would \\nmove to the occupied West Bank13 and, to that end, budget allocations to several other \\ncivilian ministries would be increased14 according to media, a senior Israeli Minister \\nlater clarified that the proposal of the Additional Minister did not represent \\ngovernment policy.15 \\n7. \\nThese measures, in particular the transfer of wide administrative powers relating \\nto settlements and land administration from the military authorities to Israeli civilians, \\nelected and accountable to the population of Israel, could facilitate annexation in \\nviolation of international law, including the Charter. Moreover, the changes explicitly \\nreflect the facts on the ground, namely, that Israel has been administering the occupied \\nWest Bank in a manner that discriminates against the protected population. 16 \\n__________________ \\n \\n7  Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations \\nconcerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (Hague Regulations), \\narts. 42–43, 46 and 55–56; Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in \\nTime of War of 12 August 1949 (Fourth Geneva Convention), arts. 47, 53 and 64; and A/75/376, \\npara. 13. \\n \\n8 Israel, Basic Law: The Government, Article 24a (Amendment No.11), on file with OHCHR.

Settlement expansion \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAdvancement, including planning and tenders  \\n \\n9. \\nAdvancement of plans for settlement construction increased. 19 Plans for the \\nconstruction of some 16,500 housing units were advanced or approved, of which \\n11,400 are in Area C and 5,090 are in East Jerusalem, an increase of 58 per cent and \\n154 per cent, respectively.20 \\n10. Israeli authorities issued tenders for approximately 1,350 new settlement \\nhousing units (1,260 in Area C and 90 in East Jerusalem). In Area C alone, a total of \\n1,240 settlement construction starts were officially recorded in the period between \\n1 July 2022 and 31 March 2023. \\n11. \\nPlans to consolidate the ring of settlements that will encircle East Jerusalem and \\nseparate it from other parts of the West Bank were further developed. Discussion of \\nobjections to the construction of over 3,400 housing units between East Jerusalem \\nand Ma‘ale Adummim (the E1 area), one of the steps for the final approval of the \\nplan, was scheduled for September, but was postponed to March. It was then \\npostponed again and is now scheduled to occur by 12 June 2023.21 If implemented, \\nthis plan would sever the connection between the northern and southern West Bank \\nand eliminate the possibility of a viable and contiguous Palestinian State. 22 \\n12. In the southern part of East Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities advanced plans on \\n5 September for some 700 units in the new settlement of Givat Hashaked, adjacent to \\nthe Palestinian neighbourhoods of Sharafat and Bayt Safafa. 23 On 29 March, the \\nJerusalem Local Planning Committee rejected objections to the “Lower Aqueduct” \\nplan,24 which envisages the building of 1,465 housing units between the settlements \\nof Har Homa and Givat Hamatos. If approved and implemented, the four settlements \\nwould create a contiguous built-up belt, sealing off East Jerusalem from Bethlehem. \\n13. On 23 November, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected a petition 25 filed by \\nPalestinian farmers and Israeli human rights organizations against the allocation of \\n1,200 dunums of land in Khirbat al-Nahlah, near Bethlehem, for the planning of up \\nto 7,000 housing units in the new settlement of Givat Eitam (the E2 project).

The establishment and expansion of settlements in the West Bank, including \\nEast Jerusalem, have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of \\ninternational law, including relevant United Nations resolutions. 27  The Israeli \\nregulations, policies and practices affecting the Palestinians as described in the \\npresent report cumulatively create a coercive environment that is forcing Palestinians \\nto leave their homes and lands in what could amount to forcible transfer, which itself \\nis a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention that may amount to a war crime. 28  \\n \\n \\n \\nRetroactive regularization of outposts \\n \\n15. In the reporting period, Kerem Navot, an Israeli NGO, documented the \\nestablishment of 25 new outposts by settlers in the West Bank.29 Outposts are settler \\nconstructions in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, that are also illegal under \\nIsraeli law. As the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has stated, \\nthe Israeli authorities have employed multiple mechanisms to make it possible to \\nretroactively legalize outposts under Israeli law, and make them a tool for settlement \\nexpansion and takeover of large areas of Palestinian land.30 \\n16. In July, the Supreme Court of Israel reversed a High Court of Justice ruling \\nordering the evacuation of settlers from the outpost of Mitzpeh Kramim, near \\nRamallah, establishing a potentially concerning precedent for the retroactive \\nregularization of dozens of outposts and thousands of illegal structures. 31  The \\nSupreme Court ruling changed the legal framework that has been applied to the West \\nBank thus far, which prohibited the establishment of Israeli settlements on privately \\nowned Palestinian land. 32 Under international humanitarian law, private property \\ncannot be confiscated and the destruction of private property is permissible only if it \\nis rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. 33 \\n17. On 12 February, the Security Cabinet of Israel announced that it had decided to \\nretroactively legalize 10 outposts in Area C.34 According to Peace Now, an Israeli \\nNGO, six of the outposts are partially built on privately owned Palestinian land. Three \\nof the legalized outposts are partially located within Israeli-designated firing zones.35 \\n__________________ \\n \\n26 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “Shrinking space: urban \\ncontraction and rural fragmentation in the Bethlehem governorate”, Special Focus, May 2009. \\n \\n27  Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 49(6); Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the \\nOccupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.

In addition to approving plans to build 7,200 housing units in West Bank \\nsettlements, in February, the Israeli authorities regularized four additional outposts as \\nneighbourhoods of existing settlements, 36  despite the lack of spatial contiguity \\nbetween them. 37 Israeli media reported that the Israeli Government has plans to \\nregularize 70 additional outposts.38 \\n19. These regularization procedures apply only to Israeli construction in the West \\nBank. No similar endeavours have been undertaken by the Israeli authorities to \\nlegalize Palestinian construction lacking Israeli-issued permits, which are, as a \\npractical matter, almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain because of restrictions \\nplaced by Israeli policies. Those restrictions lead to discrimination against \\nPalestinians in land allocation and planning procedures.  \\n20. Israeli authorities have taken actions, including changes to legislation, that \\npaved the way to the legalization of the Homesh outpost and the re-establishment of \\na settlement that had been evacuated in 2005. In March, the Knesset partially repealed \\nthe 2005 Disengagement Law, effectively ending the ban on Israelis entering and \\nresiding in Homesh and three other evacuated settlements located deep north in the \\nWest Bank. Despite the ban, settlers had built a yeshiva outpost on private Palestinian \\nland.39 For years, the Palestinian landowners waited for the outpost to be evacuated \\nso that they could gain to access their lands. 40 However, on 2 January, the State \\nreversed commitments that it made previously to evacuate the outpost and announced \\nthat it would amend existing laws and regularize the outpost. Settlers living in the \\noutpost have continued to regularly engage in violence and intimidation against \\nPalestinians from the adjacent village of Burqah.41 In May, the Israeli military signed \\ntwo military orders, one lifting the ban under military law on entering the outpost and \\nanother granting the Samaria Regional Council, a settlement body, jurisdiction over \\nseveral plots of State land near Homesh. Overnight on 29 May, settlers relocated the \\nyeshiva to designated State land.42 In so doing, they removed one legal argument \\nagainst a potential bid to regularize the outpost, namely, that it had been built on \\nprivate Palestinian land. The moving of the outpost will require further seizure of \\nprivately owned Palestinian land to pave a road for settlers to reach the settlement at \\nthe new site.43 \\n \\n \\n \\nB. Consolidation of settlements \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSettlement of land title \\n \\n21. In occupied East Jerusalem, Israeli authorities further advanced the process of \\nsettlement of land title, with a view to establishing land ownership registration in a \\nfinal manner. According to Israeli NGOs that monitor this process, as at 31 May, the \\nprocess had been initiated in some 199 blocks, each of which includes several plots \\n__________________ \\n \\n36 See S/PV.9263. \\n \\n37 Yesh Din, “The age of regularization”, p. 23.

The settlement of land title appears to be used to increase Israeli control over \\nadditional territory in occupied East Jerusalem. In particular, it appears to be aimed \\nat areas slated for settlement expansion or new settlement construction (such as Atarot \\nalong the northern flank of East Jerusalem, Givat Hamatos and Givat Shaked in the \\nsouthern part of East Jerusalem); areas where Jewish ownership claims have been \\nadvanced over Palestinian land; and areas where the process could lead to the \\ndeclaration of Palestinian property as “absentee” based on the Absentee Property Law \\nand handed over to the Custodian of Absentee Property. For example, in the Wadi \\nHulwah area of Silwan, a Palestinian neighbourhood next to the Old City of Jerusalem \\nthat has been targeted for settlement expansion, settlement of title was initiated in 13 \\nblocks covering some 95 per cent of buildings or sites taken over by settlers. 45  \\n23. The finalization of this process would have enormous implications, placing \\nthousands of Palestinians at risk of forced eviction and forcible transfer.  \\n \\n \\n \\nInfrastructure development \\n \\n24. Israeli authorities continued to expand roads and infrastructure connecting and \\nsuburbanizing settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, a practice that \\nentrenches control over occupied Palestinian land and promotes settlement \\nexpansion.46  \\n25. According to a media report, the Israeli Government allocated 25 per cent of the \\nbudget of the Ministry of Transport for 2023–2024, amounting to 3.5 billion new \\nIsraeli shekels (some $972 million), to a five-year development plan to build new \\nroads and upgrade existing ones serving settlements in the West Bank. 47 The plan \\ncontinues the pursuit of three long-standing strategic goals: strengthening “lateral \\ncorridors”, which connect Israeli cities and settlements east-west and fragment north-\\nsouth Palestinian contiguity; completing bypass roads that allow settlers to commute \\nmore easily while avoiding passing through Palestinian towns; and developing and \\nannexing the settlement of Ma‘ale Adummim.48 \\n26. Under The plan, 30 million new Israeli shekels (more than $8 million) are \\nallocated for the advancement of the “Fabric of Life” road, to the east of Jerusalem, \\nthat is intended to be used exclusively by Palestinians. The road would divert \\nPalestinian traffic between the southern and central West Bank away from the road \\nconnecting the Ma‘ale Adummim settlement and Jerusalem and lead, through an \\nunderpass, to the “Eastern Ring Road”, where Israeli and Palestinian traffic is already \\nseparated by a wall. The project would allow the checkpoint controlling access to \\nJerusalem from the east to be moved further into the West Bank and make the Ma‘ale \\nAdummim settlement contiguous with Israel. 49  The land for the planned road, \\n__________________ \\n \\n44 Data from Ir Amim and Bimkom. \\n \\n45 Ir Amim and Bimkom, “The grand land theft”, June 2023.  \\n \\n46 Breaking the Silence, “Highway to annexation: Israeli road and transportation infrastructure \\ndevelopment in the West Bank”, December 2020. \\n \\n47 Jeremy Sharon, “Budget dedicated billions for West Bank roads, settlements and illegal \\noutposts”, 25 May 2023; www.gov.il/he/Departments/news/09-08-2023 (Hebrew); and \\nwww.gov.il/he/departments/news/mot_budget_23-24 (Hebrew). \\n \\n48 Breaking the Silence, “Highway to annexation”. \\n \\n49  Hagar Shazaf, “Road for Palestinians in strategic West Bank area”, Haaretz, 2 May 2023. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554 \\n \\n23-20717\\n8/20 \\n \\nincluding significant portions located in Area B, was requisitioned in December 2016 \\nfor “military needs”.50 \\n27. Nearly 2 billion new Israeli shekels were allocated to upgrade and reroute \\nRoad 60, the main north-south traffic artery, including finalization of a section \\nbypassing the Palestinian town of Huwwarah, in the area of Nablus (see para. 58 \\nbelow). While all Israeli settlements along Road 60 have direct access to the road, the \\npopulation of many Palestinian localities must use long detours in order to use it.  \\n28. The construction of roads designed to connect and serve settlements requires \\nextensive confiscation of Palestinian land, uprooting of trees and crops, and changes \\nto the local geography and economy that violate the human rights of Palestinians, \\nsuch as the right to property and adequate standard of living, including by damaging \\nor destroying their livelihoods. Such roads limit the possibilities for Palestinian \\ncommunities to grow and often make travel between Palestinian communities more \\nonerous.51  \\n \\n \\n \\nIV. Impact of settlements on human rights \\n \\n \\n29. More than 56 years of Israeli military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian \\nTerritory – the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza – and continued \\nexpansion of settlements over Palestinian land have severely affected a wide range of \\nthe Palestinian people’s rights, including the right to self-determination.52  \\n \\n \\n \\nA. Housing, land and property rights \\n \\n \\n30. In parallel with the expansion of settlements and infrastructure for settlers, Israel \\nimplements extremely restrictive and discriminatory planning policies aimed at \\ncontaining Palestinians in Areas A and B of the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.  \\n31. Israeli demolition of Palestinian properties sharply increased during the \\nreporting period. The year 2022 saw the greatest number of homes demolished since \\n2016. 53 The Israeli authorities, citing lack of building permits, which are almost \\nimpossible to obtain, demolished, confiscated or sealed 1,000 Palestinian-owned \\nstructures, including 145 donor-funded structures, across the occupied West Bank, \\nincluding East Jerusalem, resulting in the forcible eviction and displacement of 1,020 \\nPalestinians (263 men, 235 women and 520 children), and loss of livelihood and \\nservices for tens of thousands of others. 54  The greatest numbers of structures \\ndemolished were in Area C (815) and in East Jerusalem (181, including 78 structures \\nself-demolished by their owners to avoid paying fines and charges).55  \\n \\n \\n \\nArea C \\n \\n32. Area C represents 60 per cent of the occupied West Bank, including most of its \\nresources, and remains under full Israeli control.

At least 39 structures in Area C were demolished based on Military Order \\n1797,58 which provides only a 96-hour notice and extremely limited legal grounds to \\nchallenge the demolition orders. This order, in principle, allows the demolition of \\nboth Palestinian and Israeli structures deemed as “new”. Since the order came into \\nforce in 2019 and until the first half of 2020, five times more demolition orders were \\nissued for Palestinian structures than Israeli ones. Considering the extensive \\nunlicensed construction in settlements and outposts, the figures indicate \\ndiscriminatory application of the order against Palestinians. 59  \\n34. Israeli authorities demolished two schools in Area C. 60 On 7 May, the Civil \\nAdministration of Israel demolished, for the second time, a school serving 40 students \\nin Jubbit al-Dhib, east of Bethlehem, following a petition by the settler organization \\nRegavim. An Israeli court ordered the demolition of the school on the grounds that it \\nwas built without permit and unsafe for students. Reportedly, Israeli authorities had \\npreviously rejected a planning scheme for the village under which the renovation of \\nthe school would have been allowed.61 As at 31 May, at least 50 Palestinian schools \\nin Area C and 8 in East Jerusalem, serving around 6,500 students, were at risk of \\nimpending demolition.62 \\n35. In May, the Ministry of Settlements and National Missions of Israel announced \\nthat it would double budget allocations for the “land departments” of settlement \\ncouncils to hire additional patrol units and purchase such equipment as drones in order \\nto monitor and report unauthorized Palestinian construction to the Civil \\nAdministration.63 According to a media report, when funding for these efforts began \\nin 2022, an Israeli minister stated they were aimed at countering “the takeover” of \\nArea C by Palestinians, an argument often used not to allow Palestinian \\nconstruction.64  \\n \\n \\n \\nHebron (H2 area)  \\n \\n36. Israeli settlers and the Civil Administration increased activities to strengthen \\ncontrol over sensitive locations in the old city of Hebron (H2 area) that have been \\ndeclared “closed military areas” since the late 1990s. On 6 July 2022 and 18 April \\n2023, unknown persons used bulldozers to demolish two buildings hosting 12 \\nPalestinian shops in the old vegetable market. The Palestinian owners reportedly \\ncomplained to the Israeli police, but there was no follow-up. The area is off-limits to \\nPalestinians and heavily monitored by Israeli security forces.

Between 3 and 10 May, the Civil Administration delivered eviction orders for \\nthree Palestinian properties in the area of the old municipality headquarters, claiming \\nthem as “State land”. According to Israeli media, the Government of Israel had \\nannounced plans to transfer ownership of some 70 buildings in H2 to settlers.65  \\n \\n \\n \\nEast Jerusalem \\n \\n38. After Palestinians fatally shot Israeli civilians in East Jerusalem in January \\n2023, the Minister of National Security of Israel ordered the police to expedite \\ndemolitions and “bring back order” in the city.66 February saw the highest number of \\ndemolitions in East Jerusalem in a single month since 2019,67 raising concerns of \\ncollective punishment. At least a third of all Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem lack \\nIsraeli-issued building permits and are therefore at risk of demolition. 68 Collective \\npunishment is expressly prohibited by international humanitarian law 69  and is \\nincompatible with several human rights obligations.70 The Committee against Torture \\nconsiders that the policy of punitive house demolitions violates article 16 of the \\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \\nPunishment.71 \\n39. On 17 May, Israeli authorities demolished two buildings comprising three \\nhomes each in the Wadi Qaddum area of Silwan and forcibly evicted 39 Palestinians \\n(7 men, 10 women and 22 children), citing lack of a building permit.  \\n40. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem face the threat of forced eviction \\nfollowing claims initiated mostly by settler organizations 72 to take over Palestinian \\nproperty, in particular in the Old City and surrounding areas. On 11 May, After a 45-\\nyear legal battle, the Israeli authorities notified Nora Gaith (67 years old) and Mustafa \\nSub Laban (72 years old) that, at any time after 11 June 2023, they would be forcibly \\nevicted from their home in the Old City, the home in which Ms. Gaith was born in \\n1955, if they did not leave voluntarily. Eviction proceedings were initiated by the \\nGaletzia Trust, which is associated with the settler organization Atara Leyoshna, \\nclaiming ownership of the property on the basis of the 1970 Legal and Administrative \\nMatters Law, which is inherently discriminatory against Palestinians in relation to \\nrestitution rights for property allegedly owned before 1948.73 \\n41. Under the discriminatory planning regime of Israel, demolitions and resulting \\nforced evictions entail numerous violations of human rights,74 including the right to \\n__________________ \\n \\n65 Hagar Shezaf, “Netanyahu government pledges to advance transfer of swaths of West Bank lands \\nto pre-1948 Jewish owners”, Haaretz, 12 January 2023. \\n \\n66 Para. 49; Josh Breiner, “Ben-Gvir, Israel’s police chief spar over expediency of East Jerusalem \\nhome demolitions”, Haaretz, 14 February 2023; https://twitter.com/itamarbengvir/status/ \\n1619671180998504451?s=46; and https://twitter.com/itamarbengvir/status/ \\n1619967010292768770?s=46. \\n \\n67 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “West Bank demolitions \\nand displacement: an overview”, January–March 2023.  \\n \\n68 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “High numbers of \\ndemolitions: the ongoing threats of demolition for Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem”, \\nHumanitarian Bulletin: Occupied Palestinian Territory, January 2018. \\n \\n69 Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 33; and Hague Regulations, art. 50.  \\n \\n70 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 2 and 14; International Covenant on \\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, arts. 6 and 11; and A/76/333, para. 35. \\n \\n71 CAT/C/ISR/CO/5, para. 41. \\n \\n72 A/76/336, para. 35. \\n \\n73 A/72/564, para. 30. \\n \\n74 Ibid., para. 25. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554\\n \\n11/20\\n23-20717 \\n \\nadequate housing,75 and are contrary to international humanitarian law.

Forcible transfer and the extensive destruction and appropriation of \\nproperty not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly \\nmay constitute grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention and thus amount to \\nwar crimes.79  \\n \\n \\n \\nCoercive environment and forcible transfer \\n \\n42. Since the High Court of Justice of Israel approved their eviction in May 2022,80 \\npressure has mounted on some 1,150 Palestinian residents of 12 Palestinian herding \\ncommunities to leave the Israeli-designated Firing Zone 918 in Masafer Yatta. The \\nIsraeli authorities demolished or confiscated 33 structures, 81  including a donor-\\nfunded school in Isfay al-Fawqa, carried out military drills and set up checkpoints, \\nseverely restricting access to water, education and humanitarian assistance. after the \\nHigh Court of Justice handed down its judgement, which is inconsistent with \\ninternational law,82 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \\nRights (OHCHR) has documented that settlers continued to live in and operate farms \\nin the area, thereby helping to negatively affect essential living conditions for \\nPalestinian herders. From 2 to 5 May, settlers from a newly established outpost \\noverlooking the hamlet of Maghayir al-Abid blocked Palestinians’ access to their \\ngrazing lands and water cisterns and attacked Palestinians. On 4 May, settlers \\nphysically attacked a Palestinian shepherd and killed two of his sheep. As Palestinians \\ngathered to protest, Israeli security forces arrested and detained the shepherd for five \\ndays.83 In February, the Israeli authorities announced that they would retroactively \\nlegalize the Avigail outpost, 84 although it is located partially in Firing Zone 918, \\nwhich is the reason that Israel has used to justify the eviction of the Palestinian \\ncommunity. In the light of the data presented above on enforcement of the rules \\nrelated to illegal construction, this case appears to illustrate the differentiated \\ntreatment that Israeli authorities give to settlers with regard to the enforcement of \\nrestrictions on construction in the firing zone, to the detriment of Palestinians. 85  \\n43. Several herding communities near Ramallah were forced to leave their homes \\nunder similar coercive conditions, raising concerns that they may have been forcibly \\ntransferred. 86  In February, six families consisting of 37 persons, including 21 \\nchildren, left their community of Wadi al-Siq, north-east of Ramallah, following the \\narrival of a group of settlers with some 200 sheep. The Settlers set up a tent 1 km \\naway, took control of water sources and grazing land, and started harassing the \\n__________________ \\n \\n75 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 11. \\n \\n76  A/77/493, para. 66. \\n \\n77  A/HRC/43/64, para. 44. \\n \\n78  Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 53; and Hague Regulations, arts. 46 and 55–56.  \\n \\n79 Fourth Geneva Convention, arts. 49, 53 and 147; Hague Regulations, arts. 46 and 56; and \\nA/HRC/52/76, para. 26. \\n \\n80 A/HRC/52/76, para. 52; and A/77/493, para. 19. \\n \\n81 Data from the United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \\n \\n82  A/HRC/52/76, para. 52; A/77/493, para. 19; and OHCHR, “UN experts alarmed by Israel high \\ncourt ruling on Masafer Yatta and risk of imminent forcible transfer of Palestinians”, 16 May \\n2022.  \\n \\n83 Data from the United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \\n \\n84 See para. 17 and note 37 above. \\n \\n85  See also, A/76/336, paras. 55–57. \\n \\n86 A/HRC/49/85, para. 29. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554 \\n \\n23-20717\\n12/20 \\n \\ncommunity daily. On 22 May, the Bedouin herding community of Ayn Samiyah, east \\nof Ramallah, consisting of 26 families and 132 residents (27 men, 37 women and 68 \\nchildren) dismantled their homes and left after settlers tried to take their sheep.87 By \\n31 May, they had resettled in different locations in Area B. The community had been \\nliving under the pressure of settler violence, reduced grazing land and repeated \\ndemolitions. Previously, in July 2022, about 100 people had been forced to leave their \\ncommunity of Ra’s al-Tin.88 More than 1,000 herders have been displaced in similar \\ncircumstances since the beginning of 2022. Settler violence and the failure to hold \\nperpetrators accountable, together with Palestinians’ inability to obtain approvals to \\nbuild, demolitions, evictions, movement restrictions and ongoing settlement \\nexpansion have created a coercive environment that contributes to displacement that \\nmay amount to forcible transfer, which is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva \\nConvention. \\n44. On 7 May, the High Court of Justice rejected a petition from the settler \\norganization Regavim demanding the immediate eviction of 190 Palestinians from \\nthe Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar and accepted that the Government would \\ndecide when to carry out the eviction based on reasons of “national security and \\nforeign relations”. 89  The community remains at risk of forcible transfer. 90  The \\nAdditional Minister in the Ministry of Defence responsible for settlement policy \\nstated that the inhabitants would be evicted not because of the site’s illegality, but \\nbecause it was located in “the area that will decide if … there will be territorial \\ncontiguity that will connect Bethlehem with Nablus and Ramallah”. 91  \\n \\n \\n \\nB. Settlement-related violence  \\n \\n \\n45. Settler violence against Palestinians almost doubled, with 1,003 incidents \\nresulting in Palestinian deaths, injuries and/or property damage. Settlers killed \\n6 Palestinian men and injured 368 other Palestinians (289 men, 39 women and 40 \\nchildren). In addition, two Palestinians (one man and one boy) were killed either by \\nIsraeli security forces or settlers. A total of 2,109 Palestinians were injured and at \\nleast 6 were killed by Israeli security forces in settler-related incidents. Settlers \\nvandalized more than 16,740 Palestinian-owned trees and saplings and 943 vehicles, \\ndamaged homes and crops, and killed or stole livestock.  \\n46. Attacks by Palestinians against Israelis also spiked. In the West Bank, \\nPalestinians killed 24 Israelis (16 men, 4 women, 3 boys and 1 girl), of whom three \\nwere members of the Israeli security forces, and injured at least 136 Israelis, \\naccording to Israeli sources.92  \\n47. Settler attacks further escalated in gravity, with increased use of live \\nammunition and increased incidents of arson of Palestinian houses and vehicles by \\nmobs of settlers. On 26 February, hundreds of settlers terrorized Huwwarah and \\nnearby communities after two settlers were killed by Palestinians.

Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states \\nthat any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to \\ndiscrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.  \\n48. Citing self-defence, settlers commonly carry firearms and are encouraged by \\npolitical leaders at the highest level, such as the Minister of National Security, to use \\nthem against “terrorists”,94 without facing significant restrictions or accountability. \\nOn 6 April, During Ramadan, an Israeli settler living in an outpost in the Old City of \\nJerusalem shot, for no apparent reason, at a 14-year-old Palestinian boy from a \\ndistance of 1 m. The boy had returned home shortly after midnight to find the gate to \\nhis home barred by the settler. After a brief verbal altercation, the settler shot the boy \\nin the neck and then in the arm. The Israeli police arrested the settler on the same day \\nand released him on house arrest shortly thereafter. On 27 January, a Palestinian man \\nkilled six Israelis (four men, one woman and one boy) and one Ukrainian woman in \\nthe settlement of Neve Ya‘aqov, in occupied East Jerusalem. Later in the evening, a \\nsettler driving by the entrance of Bayta on Road 60 rolled down the car window and \\nshot repeatedly at Palestinians gathered in the street who were seemingly celebrating \\nthe attack against the Israelis. The settler injured five Palestinian men with live \\nammunition and drove off. \\n49. Significant settler violence continued to emanate from settler outposts. Settler \\nattacks and daily harassment from outposts appeared to be designed to terrorize \\nPalestinians, make the lives unbearable and take over their land. 95 \\n50. Kisan, a village of 600 people south of Bethlehem, has been increasingly \\ntargeted by settlers from surrounding outposts and settlements. Nine attacks against \\nthe village were recorded, 96 mostly from the settlement of Ma‘ale Amos and the \\noutpost of Ibei HaNahal, resulting in damage or injuries. For instance, on 19 October, \\na Palestinian couple was accompanied by Israeli and international activists to harvest \\ntheir olive trees near Ma‘ale Amos. They passed by a tent that had been set up by \\nsettlers on their land a week earlier and found most of their more than 300 olive trees \\nalready harvested and sprayed with chemicals. Shortly afterwards, 30 masked settlers \\narmed with clubs and stones arrived and beat up and injured the couple and at least \\nthree women activists, including a 70-year-old Israeli woman who lost consciousness \\nduring the attack. The couple told OHCHR they did not report the attack to the police \\nbecause they feared that the Israeli authorities would revoke the man’s medical permit \\nfor cancer treatment in Jerusalem in reprisal. Herders in the village stated that, owing \\nto settler violence and daily harassment, they were resorting to buying fodder for their \\nanimals instead of grazing them in lands near settlements and outposts, resulting in \\nfinancial loss. \\n51. OHCHR documented an increasing number of cases where Israeli security \\nforces actively supported or joined settler attacks. In one case, on 21 October, a \\nsettlement security guard wearing the uniform of the Israeli security forces was caught \\non camera handing a teargas grenade to a settler attacking Palestinians in Burin, near \\nNablus, during the olive harvest.97  \\n52.

Convictions were secured in only 3 per cent of those cases. In 81.5 per \\ncent of cases, the Israeli police closed the investigation primarily on the grounds that \\nthe offender was “unknown” (64 per cent) or for “insufficient evidence” (21 per cent), \\nindicating a failure in the investigation.98 In stark contrast, between 2018 and 2021, \\n96 per cent of cases opened by military prosecutors against Palestinians ended in \\nconviction, clearly indicating discriminatory law enforcement. 99 In 38 per cent of the \\ncases, Palestinians chose not to file a complaint, owing to lack of trust in the Israeli \\nauthorities or fearing retaliation.100 Of additional concern, out of all the indictments \\nissued against settlers, 26 per cent included Israeli children as offenders.101 \\n53. Settler violence has not been adequately prevented and there is a lack of \\neffective investigation into such violence resulting in widespread impunity for those \\nresponsible, including members of the Israeli Security Forces who participate in \\nsettler attacks. Under international humanitarian law, the occupying power must \\nprotect the protected population against all acts or threats of violence.  \\n \\n \\n \\nCase study \\n \\n \\n \\nState-backed settler violence in Huwwarah, Nablus Governorate \\n \\n54. Huwwarah, Burin, Aynabus, Urif, Madama and Asirah al-Qibliyah are \\nPalestinian towns at the bottom of Jabal Salman mountain, south of Nablus, with a \\ntotal population of around 21,000 inhabitants. Traditionally, these communities relied \\non farming and herding for their livelihood. Pursuant to the Oslo Accords, the built-\\nup areas of the towns were designated as being part of Area B and most surrounding \\nlands as being part of Area C. In 1983, the settlement of Yitzhar was built on top of \\nthe mountain, on land belonging to the six villages. As additional settlements and \\noutposts were built, the Palestinian communities progressively lost access to their \\nlands and were subjected to settler violence. \\n55. Huwwarah is located on Road 60, the main artery connecting the West Bank \\nfrom north to south. The town became an important trading centre because of its \\nlocation and the fact that farmland became increasingly off-limits to Palestinians. By \\n2022, it had 8,000 inhabitants and 400 establishments, including restaurants, grocery \\nshops, car showrooms and repair centres. \\n56. In 2017, Israeli authorities reportedly approved the construction of a highway \\nto connect Jerusalem to settlements south of Nablus, 102 bypassing Huwwarah to the \\neast. Set to open in 2024, the road will be 5.5 km long, have four lanes, four bridges \\nand several crossings. 103  Its construction required extensive expropriation of \\nPalestinian land, including 406 dunums of private land104 confiscated by the Civil \\nAuthority from Palestinians primarily from the towns Huwwarah, Bayta and Awarta. \\nIn addition to that land, a further 1,100 dunums were seized for the building of the \\nroad. According to the Israeli authorities, the road will resolve traffic congestion and \\nalso benefit Palestinians. However, the road, the construction of which has already \\nrequired the destruction of trees in Palestinian lands, as well as properties and \\n__________________ \\n \\n98  Yesh Din, “Data sheet, December 2022: law enforcement on Israeli civilians in the West Bank \\n(settler violence) 2005–2022”, 1 February 2023. \\n \\n99  A/78/502, para. 43. \\n \\n100  Yesh Din, “Data sheet, December 2022”. \\n \\n101  Data from Yesh Din (on file with the Secretariat). \\n \\n102 Mainly Yitzhar, Itamar, Har Bracha and Alon Moreh.

Settler harassment and attacks in Huwwarah and surrounding towns have \\nsteadily increased. The number of attacks increased during the reporting period to 70, \\ncompared with 12 attacks in 2020 and 14 attacks in 2021.  \\n58. On 26 February, approximately 400 settlers from Yitzhar and other nearby \\nsettlements gathered and attacked Palestinians with stones, batons and Molotov \\ncocktails, and set fire to homes, shops and vehicles in Huwwarah and nearby towns. \\nThe rampage occurred several hours after an armed Palestinian man had shot and \\nkilled two settlers (aged 19 and 21) from the settlement Har Brakha as they were \\ndriving through Huwwarah, and a few days after Israeli security forces had killed 12 \\nPalestinians, including one child, in an operation that was conducted in broad daylight \\nin the old city of Nablus.105 \\n59. During multiple and simultaneous settler attacks that lasted for hours, one \\nPalestinian man was killed by either Israeli security forces or settlers (see para. 66 \\nbelow) and 387 other Palestinian were injured (161 men, 137 women, 46 boys and 43 \\ngirls) in the towns of Huwwarah, Za‘tarah, Burin and Bayta, of whom 378 were \\ninjured by Israeli security forces and 9 by settlers. According to the Israeli security \\nforces, one soldier was injured by settlers. Settlers caused extensive property damage, \\nestimated at $5 million by the municipality of Huwwarah. at least 37 homes were set \\non fire or vandalized, resulting in the displacement of 78 Palestinians. In addition, at \\nleast eight commercial structures were burned down and 55 Palestinian privately \\nowned vehicles and 1,200 scrapped vehicles were torched.106  \\n60. Given their traditional caregiver role, women were mostly at home with children \\nat the time of the attack, in many cases without husbands and fathers. They accounted \\nfor most of the Palestinians who were injured as settlers attempted to torch buildings. \\nA 29-year-old mother of three told OHCHR that, from her window, she saw about 200 \\nsettlers, accompanied by several Israeli soldiers, approaching Yitzhar junction. The \\nSettlers threw stones at Palestinian homes. They then approached the car park of her \\nhusband’s business and set fire to some 100 vehicles parked there. The smoke around \\nthe house became so intense, the woman and children feared that they would be \\nburned alive. The woman, looking for breathable air, took her children, including a \\ntwo-year-old, to the roof of the building. She stayed there with another neighbour and \\nher three children, in the dark, until 2330 hours. The family business sustained \\n1 million new Israeli shekels ($250,000) in damage. The woman described several \\nmembers of the Israeli security forces moving “back and forth” as the arson was \\noccurring, without acting to stop the settlers. Illustrating the strong psychological \\nimpact that the event had had on Palestinian residents, several families told OHCHR \\nthat children refused to sleep in their houses for days after the rampage, fearing \\nfurther attacks.  \\n61. Settler-related violence negatively affects women’s mobility, further reinforcing \\nnegative aspects of traditional gender roles. In one case documented by OHCHR, a \\nPalestinian woman reported that her husband had not allowed her to go out of the \\nhouse alone, not even for grocery shopping, since the attacks and following the \\ndeployment of Israeli security forces snipers on a floor of their building to protect \\nsettlers.  \\n__________________ \\n \\n105 A/78/502, para. 16. \\n \\n106 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “Protection of civilians: \\nOccupied Palestinian Territory”, 14–27 February 2023.  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554 \\n \\n23-20717\\n16/20 \\n \\n62. In the hours preceding the rampage, settlers reportedly had been organizing on \\nsocial media, with calls made on dozens of WhatsApp groups to concentrate in \\nHuwwarah and attack Palestinians. 107 Although the Israeli Defense Forces central \\ncommand responsible for army troops in the West Bank called the attacks a “pogrom” \\nand “terror”, it stated that Israeli security forces were caught off guard by the number \\nof attackers and the scale and intensity of violence. 108  \\n63. Yesh Din stated that, in most of the cases that it documented, the victims refused \\nto file a criminal complaint because they did not trust the Israeli authorities, given \\nthat Israeli security forces were present during the rampage. Multiple videos and \\ntestimony taken by OHCHR, other organizations and the media all indicate that many \\nsettlers were masked and carried out the attacks as groups of Israeli security forces \\nstood by them, but without intervening. OHCHR documented cases where Israeli \\nsecurity forces fired tear gas canisters, rubber-coated metal bullets and live bullets at \\nPalestinians who attempted to defend themselves by throwing stones at settlers.  \\n64. At 2000 hours, approximately 20 to 30 settlers coming from Huwwarah \\napproached the village of Za‘tarah and started throwing stones. A larger number of \\nPalestinians gathered and responded by also throwing stones, forcing the settlers to \\nwithdraw. At about 2015 hours, some 60 settlers returned with a settlement security \\nguard and three Israeli army jeeps. The settlers again threw stones at Palestinians. \\nWhen Palestinians responded in a similar fashion, Israeli soldiers and civilians fired \\nlive ammunition at them. One shot hit Sameh Aqtash in the abdomen; he died shortly \\nafterwards from his wounds. Another Palestinian man was injured by live \\nammunition. As at 31 May, there was no information publicly available on any \\ninvestigation by Israeli security forces.  \\n65. Far from being isolated, this case fits into a well-established pattern of \\ndiscriminatory law enforcement in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Settler \\nand Israeli security forces activities and use of firearms are increasingly interwoven, \\nwith their distinction becoming increasingly difficult to discern as these events, \\nincluding the killings, show.109 \\n66. Some Israeli leaders from extreme right-wing political parties that are in power \\npraised the 26 February violence and incited further violence against Huwwarah, \\nwhich is perceived as associated with Palestinian attackers. Those statements have \\nincluded calls for the “erasure” of Huwwarah. A Member of the Knesset from the \\ncoalition stated “a closed, burnt Huwwarah, that is what I want to see”. 110 A few days \\nlater, the Additional Minister in the Ministry of Defence, speaking on radio, said that \\nIsrael should “wipe out” Huwwarah.111 Although other Israeli officials condemned \\nthe statement and the Additional Minister partially retracted his words, a campaign to \\n“erase” the town continued and became viral on social media.112 The Attorney General \\nof Israel has reportedly opened an investigation for incitement against the Member of \\nKnesset.113 \\n__________________ \\n \\n107 Gianluca Mezzofiore and others, “Israel’s military called the settler attack on this Palestinian \\ntown a ‘pogrom’.

Israeli security forces stated they would thoroughly investigate the incident. 114 \\nAlthough hundreds were involved in the rampage, the Israeli police only arrested \\neight settlers on 1 March. The following day, an Israeli court ordered all eight to be \\nreleased, reportedly because no evidence was presented against them. 115 On the same \\nday, the Minister of Defence issued four-month administrative detention orders \\nagainst two of those who were released, including a 17-year-old boy suspected of \\ninitiating the rampage and attacking Israeli security forces, as well as “previous acts \\nof terror”. 116  The Central District Court of Israel shortened the administrative \\ndetention period from four months to two months for the boy, who was released on \\n2 April, and reduced by one month the detention period for the adult, who was \\nexpected to be released on 2 June 2023. There was widespread criticism and outrage \\namong public figures and Israeli politicians, who said that placing the two in \\nadministrative detention without charge or trial, a practice extensively used against \\nPalestinians,117 was “anti-democratic”.118 On 13 March, two settlers from the outpost \\nof Giv’at Ronen were arrested by the Israeli police on suspicion of involvement in \\nthe Huwwarah riots and taken for interrogation by the Israel Security Agency. 119 \\n68. The Huwwarah rampage demonstrates, in addition to a lack of criminal \\naccountability for the perpetrators, how difficult it is for Palestinians to claim \\ncompensation for damages caused by Israeli settlers. According to the organization \\nLegal Aid for Palestinians, which is representing eight Palestinian families that are \\nsuing the Israel Defense Forces for damages for failing to protect them, it is difficult, \\nif not impossible, to prove a civil case if no perpetrator is identified by authorities. \\nOn the other hand, the Israeli government had made no offer of compensation as at \\n31 May.  \\n69. Emboldened by political backing and impunity, settlers returned to attack the \\ntowns of Huwwarah, Za‘tarah, Burin and Qaryut in the following weeks. On 6 March, \\nat night, Israeli settlers were captured on closed-circuit television cameras assaulting \\na Palestinian family in their car, including a 2-year-old girl, with an axe, stones and \\npepper spray. A 61-year-old man was injured in the head. In a rare development, on \\n30 March, an Israeli prosecutor charged two settlers in relation to the attack.120 On \\n27 March, groups of Israeli settlers again entered Huwwarah and carried out attacks, \\ninjuring six Palestinian men, and burned or vandalized five homes, three shops and \\n17 vehicles.  \\n70. In response to attacks by Palestinians and settler “price tag” attacks, the Israeli \\nsecurity forces imposed movement and other restrictions on Palestinians only, \\npurportedly to prevent violence. Following the events of 26 February and until \\n3 March, Israeli security forces closed Huwwarah to Palestinian traffic and forced all \\nshops and business to shut down. The town was shut down again for two days after \\nthe 27 March attacks. In subsequent weeks, Israeli security forces also closed the road \\nconnecting Bayta to Huwwarah and all side streets leading to the Huwwarah main \\n__________________ \\n \\n114 Emanuel Fabian, “Suspects in Huwara settler rampage out of custody; IDF vows to probe \\n‘lawlessness’”, Times of Israel, 28 February 2023. \\n \\n115 Emanuel Fabian, “Two suspects in Huwara rampage, one a minor, sent to administrative \\ndetention”, Times of Israel, 28 February 2023. \\n \\n116 Elisha Ben Kimon, “Settler officials intervene for teen suspected of setting fire in Huwara”, \\nY Net News, 18 May 2023. \\n \\n117  Ibid. \\n \\n118  A/78/502, para. 37. \\n \\n119 Hagar Shezaf, “Two settlers placed in administrative detention over Huwara riot”, Haaretz, \\n13 March 2023. \\n \\n120 Emanuel Fabian, “Two settlers charged with terror for attack on Palestinians in Huwara”, Times \\nof Israel, 30 March 2023.  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554 \\n \\n23-20717\\n18/20 \\n \\nroad with earth mounds, leaving some families completely isolated for several days. \\nMeanwhile, settlers had free passage through the town. \\n71. The livelihood and activity of shop owners in the main street of Huwwarah were \\ndeeply impacted. As at 31 May, Israeli security forces maintained a significant \\npresence in the town, including a new military post and snipers deployed in residential \\nbuildings. According to several shop owners, Israeli security forces have harassed \\nthem and their customers by stopping passers-by and checking their identification \\ndocuments and issuing fines, thereby deterring potential customers. All of them \\nreported that their income has been reduced by half or more since the February \\nattacks. \\n72. In most cases of settler violence, Israel has repeatedly failed in its responsibility \\nas the occupying Power to protect the Palestinian population.  \\n73. Systematic and increasingly severe settler violence committed with the \\nacquiescence and support of Israeli security forces, including arbitrary use of force, \\nputs at risk Palestinians’ rights to life and security of the person. 121  \\n74. Settler violence, the presences of Israeli security forces and Israeli plans for \\nsettlement expansion have, in combination, further exacerbated a coercive \\nenvironment in the area and increased the risk of forcible transfer.  \\n \\n \\n \\nV. Settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan  \\n \\n \\n75. Eighteen months have passed since the Government of Israel announced its goal \\nto “double the population of the Golan Heights” in order to “advance the interests of \\nthe State of Israel.”122 According to the government’s projected rate of growth, the \\nsettler population in the occupied Golan will increase by 23,000 before 2027. As a \\nresult, the number of settlers has, for the first time, exceeded the local Syrian \\npopulation of 28,000.123 \\n76. On 20 June 2023, Israel commenced work on 23 wind turbines in orchards near \\nthe towns of Majdal Shams and Mas‘adah in the occupied Syrian Golan. Israeli police \\nprovided on-site protection for works reportedly124 carried out by Energix, an Israeli \\ncompany. As a result, clashes erupted between Syrians protesting against the \\nconstruction of the wind turbines and Israeli police, reportedly resulting in minor \\ninjuries to three protesters and three police. \\n77. Settlement expansion and such commercial activity as the construction of wind \\nturbines, which could potentially have a detrimental effect on the health of the \\npopulation of the occupied Syrian Golan, further worsen the overall human rights \\nsituation and continue to limit the Syrian population’s access to land and water, in \\nviolation of a wide range of their human rights, including the rights to food, health \\nand adequate housing. \\n \\n \\n \\nVI. Conclusions and recommendations  \\n \\n \\n78. The establishment and expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan amount to the transfer by \\nIsrael of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, which is \\n__________________ \\n \\n121  A/HRC/49/85, para. 19; A/76/336, para. 19. \\n \\n122 A/77/493, para. 69. \\n \\n123 Supported by information received from NGOs working on the Syrian Golan. \\n \\n124  See Adi Hashmonai and Jack Khoury, “Druze protesters clash with police in Golan Heights over \\nwind turbine construction”, Haaretz, 20 June 2023. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554\\n \\n19/20\\n23-20717 \\n \\nprohibited under international humanitarian law, as consistently confirmed by \\nthe competent United Nations organs, including the International Court of \\nJustice.125 It may also amount to a war crime.126 \\n79. Settlement of titles constitutes an irreversible act of sovereignty by a \\npermanent regime and subverts the principle that occupation is inherently \\ntemporary.127 Ongoing action in this regard in the occupied West Bank, including \\nEast Jerusalem, is illegal under international law and increases the risk of illegal \\nappropriation of property and of forcible transfer.  \\n80. The transfer of wide administrative powers relating to settlements and land \\nadministration from the military to Israeli civilians could facilitate annexation \\nin violation of international law, including the Charter.  \\n81. The alarming increase in violence by settlers, including violence against \\nwomen, with the acquiescence and support of the Israeli security forces and the \\ncontinuing widespread impunity for such acts highlight the unwillingness of the \\nIsraeli authorities to uphold its obligations as the occupying Power to ensure as \\nfar as possible public order and to protect the Palestinian population against all \\nacts or threats of violence. In addition, Israeli security forces often apparently \\nused unlawful force, including unnecessary or disproportionate use of such lethal \\nweapons as firearms, against Palestinians during settler attacks. Settler violence \\nadversely affects the rights of Palestinian people, including the rights to security \\nof person, freedom of movement, privacy, family life, an adequate standard of \\nliving, work and education, and it is an important component of the coercive \\nenvironment that may leave some Palestinians no other choice than to leave their \\nplaces of residence.  \\n82. Systematic demolitions of Palestinian homes, based on discriminatory laws \\nand policies, are ongoing and result in forced evictions, a gross violation of \\nhuman rights.128 Forced evictions resulting from demolitions in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory are a key factor in the creation of a coercive environment. \\nThey have a negative impact on a wide range of human rights, including women’s \\nrights, and increase the risk of forcible transfer. \\n83. There was an almost total failure to ensure accountability for apparent \\nunlawful killing of Palestinians, including in instances that raise concerns of \\nextrajudicial executions and wilful killing. This is indicative of the climate of \\nimpunity that prevails with respect to excessive force against Palestinians by \\nIsraeli security forces, including in the contexts of settlement.  \\n84. The Secretary-General recalls Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in \\nwhich the Council decided that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, \\njurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights was null \\nand void and without international legal effect. \\n85. The Secretary-General recommends that Israel: \\n \\n(a) \\nImmediately and completely cease and reverse all settlement activities \\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in compliance \\nwith international law, including relevant United Nations resolutions, such as \\nSecurity Council resolution 2334 (2016); \\n__________________ \\n \\n125  A/76/336, para. 59. \\n \\n126 Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 49(6); and Rome Statute, art. 8(2)(b)(viii). \\n \\n127 Hague Regulations, arts. 43 and 55; and A/77/493, para. 72. \\n \\n128  Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/28, para. 1. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/78/554 \\n \\n23-20717\\n20/20 \\n \\n \\n(b) \\nImmediately halt demolitions and forced evictions of the Palestinian \\npopulation and cease any activity that would further contribute to a coercive \\nenvironment and/or lead to a risk of possible forcible transfer; \\n \\n(c) \\nIn line with its obligations as the occupying Power to protect the \\nPalestinian population, issue clear and unambiguous orders to Israeli security \\nforces to ensure the protection of the Palestinian population against settler \\nviolence and hold to account members of the Israeli security forces who fail to \\ncomply with such orders; \\n \\n(d) \\nEnsure that all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli security \\nforces against Palestinians, including violence against women, and damage to \\ntheir property are promptly, effectively, thoroughly and transparently \\ninvestigated; that perpetrators are prosecuted and, if convicted, punished with \\nappropriate sanctions; and that victims are provided with effective remedies, \\nincluding adequate compensation, in accordance with international standards; \\n \\n(e) \\nImmediately cease and reverse all settlement development and related \\nactivities in the occupied Syrian Golan and end discriminatory land, housing and \\ndevelopment policies, in compliance with relevant United Nations resolutions. \\n86.

Introduction \\n \\n \\n1. \\nThe present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 78/78 \\nand provides an update on the implementation of the resolution from 1 June 2023 to \\n31 May 2024. It is based on direct monitoring and information-gathering conducted \\nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) \\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and on information provided by Government \\nsources, United Nations entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The \\nreport should be read in conjunction with related reports of the Secretary-General and \\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted to the General \\nAssembly and the Human Rights Council.1 \\n2. \\nThe report contains an update on settlement advancement and its impact on the \\nhuman rights of the Palestinian people. Section III highlights settler violence against \\npastoral communities, which, combined with Israeli policies, has forced the \\ndisplacement of those communities in unprecedented numbers, compared with \\nprevious reporting periods. It also contains an update on Israeli settlements in the \\noccupied Syrian Golan. \\n \\n \\n \\nII. Legal background \\n \\n \\n3. \\nInternational human rights law and international humanitarian law apply \\nconcurrently in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, namely, Gaza and the West Bank, \\nincluding East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. This includes the Geneva \\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth \\nGeneva Convention), which is binding upon Israel as the occupying Power. A detailed \\nanalysis of the applicable legal framework can be found in previous reports of the \\nSecretary-General.2 \\n \\n \\n \\nIII. Update on settlement activities \\n \\n \\n \\nA. Legal and policy initiatives of the Government of Israel \\n \\n \\n4. \\nThe advancement of settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, \\nand the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population to the occupied West Bank, \\nincluding East Jerusalem, has been ongoing for decades.3 Policies of the current \\nGovernment of Israel are aligned to an unprecedented extent with the goals of the \\nIsraeli settler movement to expand long-term control over the West Bank, including \\nEast Jerusalem, and to steadily integrate the occupied West Bank into the State of \\nIsrael.4 The expansion of settlements in the West Bank along with settler violence, in \\nmany cases with the acquiescence and support or participation of Israeli security \\nforces, have led to numerous human rights violations. \\n5. \\nThe year 2023 was already on track to having the highest recorded number of \\nPalestinian fatalities, including child fatalities, since the United Nations began \\nsystematically recording casualties in 2005. On 7 October 2023, Hamas and other \\nPalestinian armed groups launched large-scale attacks in Israel. The attacks included \\nthe commitment of numerous acts of terror in southern Israel, in the Gaza periphery, \\nwhile thousands of rockets were launched towards population centres in Israel. Since \\n__________________ \\n \\n1 See A/HRC/55/72; and A/HRC/55/28. \\n \\n2 See A/HRC/34/38; and A/HRC/34/39. \\n \\n3 A/HRC/52/76, para. 2; and A/78/554, para. 4. \\n \\n4 A/HRC/55/72, para. 6. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/79/347\\n \\n3/20\\n24-16501 \\n \\n7 October 2023, Israeli sources have reported that more than 1,500 Israelis and \\nforeign nationals were killed in that context, including at least 338 women and 38 \\nchildren, and 690 members of the security forces. In addition, some 250 people, \\nincluding both Israelis and foreign nationals, including approximately 65 women and \\n34 children, were abducted and taken into Gaza, with some subsequently released in \\nNovember during a seven-day humanitarian pause. The subsequent Israeli military \\nresponse resulted in a catastrophic situation for the 2.1 million inhabitants of Gaza, \\nwith more than 40,700 Palestinians killed by the date of reporting, according to the \\nMinistry of Health in Gaza, the majority of whom were women or children, in major \\npart as a result of the means and methods of warfare of Israel.  \\n6. \\nSince the attacks of 7 October 2023, there has been a further marked expansion \\nof settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Violence \\nby the Israeli security forces and settlers against Palestinians increased dramatically \\nand continued during the reporting period, further entrenching the discriminatory and \\noppressive system of Israeli control over Palestinians. 5 \\n7. \\nThe transfer of authority to approve the demolition of illegal structures in \\nsettlements to the Finance Minister of Israel, who serves as an additional Minister in \\nthe Ministry of Defense, under the new Civil Administration, 6 which began in May \\n2023, has reportedly led to a sharp decrease in law enforcement operations against \\nsettlers.7 On 2 September 2023, the Government of Israel confirmed that the \\nadditional Minister had cancelled the establishment of a “special enforcement unit” \\nintended to address violations of planning and construction laws by settlers, 8 which \\nraised concerns that law enforcement operations against unauthorized Israeli \\nconstruction in settlements would be further scaled down.  \\n8. \\nOn 29 May, the Head of the Israel Defense Forces Central Command and the \\nHead of the Civil Administration (both military officers) issued two orders appointing \\na new civilian deputy for civilian affairs and delegating to him most of the authority \\nof the military Head of the Civil Administration over the administration of the West \\nBank. The new deputy reports on substantive matters to civilian officials within the \\nMinistry of Defense and is only operationally subordinate to the military chain of \\ncommand.9 Those orders effectively redistributed powers from military to civilian \\nofficials, as agreed in the coalition agreements and the agreement between the \\nMinister for Defense and the additional Minister.10 Such structural changes11 ensure \\nthat, while the military chain of command retains responsibilities for security-related \\nissues, the management of most areas of settlement advancement, land development, \\n__________________ \\n \\n5 Ibid., para. 8. \\n \\n6 A/78/554, para. 6. \\n \\n7 Hagar Shezaf, “Since Smotrich appointment, Israel nearly stopped enforcing law on illegal \\nsettlement construction”, Haaretz, 2 July 2023. \\n \\n8 State response dated 9 September 2023 in High Court of Justice of Israel, Peace Now v. the \\nMilitary Commander of the West Bank, Case No. HCJ 2368/18, Ruling of 9 May 2024.

In a subsequent order the Head of the Civil \\nAdministration appointed the deputy head of civil administration for civilian affairs and \\ndelegated all authorities listed in the previous order to him, see \\n צו -\\n בדבר -\\n הקמת -\\n מינהל -\\n אזרחי -\\n תיקון -\\n מס -\\n3\\n3\\n -\\n יהודה -\\n והשומרון -\\n מס -\\n2195\\n -\\n תשפד -\\n2024\\n.pdf (www.idf.il); and \\n כתב -\\n מינוי -\\n והאצלת -\\n סמכויות -\\n לסגן -\\n ראש -\\n ה מינהל -\\n האזרחי -\\n לעניינים -\\n אזרחיים.pdf (www.idf.il). \\n \\n10 A/78/554, para. 6; and A/HRC/55/72, para. 7. \\n \\n11 A/78/554, para. 6. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/79/347 \\n \\n24-16501\\n4/20 \\n \\nplanning and day-to-day life in Area C, as well as the legal advice that management \\nrelies upon, are vested with the additional Minister and his appointees in the Ministry. \\n9. \\nThe above delegation of administrative powers relating to land administration \\nand settlements to Israeli civilian officials answerable to the additional Minister, \\nelected and accountable to the population of Israel, appears to give further effect to \\nthe Government of Israel’s “application of sovereignty” over the West Bank12 and to \\nconsolidate the incorporation of the West Bank into the territory of Israel. According \\nto the International Court of Justice, this amounts to annexation in violation of \\ninternational law, including the Charter of the United Nations. 13 These changes reflect \\nthe facts on the ground, namely, that Israel has been administering the West Bank as \\nits own territory and in a manner that discriminates against the protected population. 14 \\n10. On 18 June, the Government of Israel simplified the approval process for Israeli \\nsettlement construction in the West Bank and expanded the authority of the additional \\nMinister to approve one of the construction stages. 15 Those changes have rendered \\nthe approval processes for construction by Israeli communities essentially identical \\nfor developments within Israel and inside settlements within the West Bank, further \\nintegrating the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, into Israeli territory.  \\n11. Further steps were taken to extend the jurisdiction of Israeli local government \\nentities to Israeli settlements and to ensure that Israeli settlers receive the same \\nservices as Israelis within Israel, further blurring the distinction between the exercise \\nof sovereignty on Israeli territory and the administration of settlements in the West \\nBank.16 On 1 April, the Knesset amended the Municipalities Ordinance, enabling the \\nMinister of the Interior to distribute revenues between municipalities proximate to \\none another, including municipalities in West Bank settlements. 17 In March, the \\narmy’s Central Commander ordered the provision of cellular coverage on all roads \\nserving settlements in the West Bank.18 On 22 May, the Knesset passed, in a \\npreliminary reading, a private bill to bring settlements from the South Hebron Hills \\ninto the jurisdiction of the Negev Hills local authority, to benefit from the budget of \\nthe Negev Development Authority.19 \\n12. According to the NGO Peace Now, Israeli authorities continued to increase \\nbudgets to settlements; funds for settlements were set to amount to more than \\n737 million shekels (some $200 million) in 2024, more than the 275 million shekels \\n($74 million) budgeted in May 2023, with 20 per cent of the Transportation Ministry \\nroad construction budget to be directed to settlements.20 In addition to having obtained \\nthe imposition of financial sanctions on mobile phone companies if they violate their \\ncoverage obligations in the West Bank “similar to the rest of the country”, the \\nCommunications Ministry announced a plan to establish a cellular infrastructure in \\nthe West Bank during 2024, with a dedicated budget of 50 million shekels. 21  \\n__________________ \\n \\n12 Ibid., para. 5. \\n \\n13 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, \\nI.C.J.

The situation in the West Bank was accompanied by calls by some Israeli \\nMinisters and Members of the Knesset for the “voluntary migration” of Palestinians \\nfrom Gaza and the re-establishment of settlements there.22 On 22 May, the Minister \\nfor Defense also announced the cancellation of the order prohibiting Israelis from \\nentering areas in the northern West Bank. This follows the partial repeal of the 2005 \\ndisengagement law, under which Israel officially withdrew from the northern West \\nBank and Gaza, and raises concerns over the potential establishment of future \\nsettlements there.23  \\n14. During the first half of 2024, several Member States announced targeted \\nrestrictive measures on certain individual settlers accused of violence. 24 According to \\nOHCHR monitoring, those measures do not appear to target those most responsible \\nfor settler violence.  \\n \\n \\n \\nB. Settlement expansion \\n \\n \\nAdvancement, including planning, tenders and construction \\n \\n15. Further steps were recorded towards the establishment and expansion of illegal \\nsettlements, including planning, tenders and construction, as well as the demolition \\nof Palestinian structures, resulting in high numbers of displaced Palestinians. The \\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that Israeli settlements \\nin the West Bank had already expanded by a record number by 30 April 2024, and \\nthat infrastructure developments, including roads that service-only settlements, \\njeopardized any practical possibility of a contiguous Palestinian State. 25 \\n16. There has been a record surge in settlement activities since 7 October, 26 \\nincluding the construction of outposts, roads, fences and roadblocks initiated by \\nsettlers with the endorsement or acquiescence of authorities. 27 Settlers increasingly \\nseized control of Area C in the West Bank, marginalizing the Palestinian population. \\nThis was reportedly supported, planned and promoted by the Israeli authorities, \\nincluding through funding farming outposts.28 \\n17. According to Peace Now, on 3 March, the Israeli Ministry of Housing \\ncommenced construction on a new settlement, known as “Amirim Neighborhood” or \\n“Ariel West” in central West Bank. Although not bordering any other settlement, \\nIsraeli authorities stated it was part of the existing Ariel settlement. The construction \\neffectively disconnects the Palestinian villages north of Salfit, such as Kifl Haris and \\nHaris, from the rest of Salfit district.29 \\n__________________ \\n \\n22 OHCHR monitoring.

As the International Court of Justice reaffirmed in its 19 July advisory opinion, \\n“the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem … have been established \\nand are being maintained in violation of international law”.30 The Court further stated \\nthat “Israel’s policies and practices, including the maintenance and expansion of \\nsettlements, the construction of associated infrastructure, including the wall, … \\namount to annexation” and that “to seek to acquire sovereignty over an occupied \\nterritory … is contrary to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations \\nand its corollary principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force”.31  \\n \\nPlans and tenders  \\n \\n19. The advancement of plans for settlement construction increased further, \\nfollowing the increase in the previous reporting period. Plans for the construction of \\nsome 19,500 housing units were advanced or approved, including 11,300 in Area C \\nand 8,200 in East Jerusalem. Overall, there was a 19 per cent increase in housing units \\nadvanced in East Jerusalem and Area C. This saw an 86 per cent increase in East \\nJerusalem and an 8 per cent increase in West Bank, respectively.32 Furthermore, Israel \\npublished tenders inviting bids from construction firms for approximately 1,600 \\nhousing units, including approximately 1,200 for East Jerusalem. This compares with \\ntenders for approximately 1,350 new settlement housing units (1,260 in Area C, 90 in \\nEast Jerusalem) in the previous reporting period.  \\n20. Meanwhile, there were 490 construction starts of housing units in Area C \\nbetween 1 July 2023 and 31 March 2024, compared with approximately 1,200 \\nbetween 1 July 2022 and 31 March 2023.33 \\n21. In 2023, the highest ever number of construction plans was promoted in West \\nBank settlements, including in East Jerusalem, including 24,700 housing units being \\nadvanced, approved or tendered – more than double the 2022 number.34 For example, \\non 2 June, the Higher Planning Committee deposited a plan for the “Sha’ar Shomron” \\nindustrial zone, which design would create a “settlement continuum” in the area. The \\nindustrial zone would be the largest in the West Bank, nearly 2,700 dunams, with \\nanticipated severe environmental impacts.35 \\n22. On 13 December, Israeli authorities approved the Lower Aqueduct plan, on both \\nsides of the Green Line, adjacent to Kibbutz Ramat Rachel and the Palestinian \\nneighbourhoods of Beit Safafa and Sur Baher. This was the first new major settlement \\nto be approved in East Jerusalem since 2012. Its construction further threatens the \\nviability of a contiguous Palestinian State as it would create a continuum between \\nGivat Hamatos and Har Homa settlements, cut off East Jerusalem from Bethlehem \\nand isolate Beit Safafa from the rest of East Jerusalem, further fragmenting the \\nPalestinian population in East Jerusalem.36 On 18 April, Israeli authorities published \\na tender for the construction of 1,047 houses in the settlement. \\n \\nDeclaration of “State land” \\n \\n23. Declaration of “State land” is one of the methods used by Israel, the occupying \\nPower, to appropriate Palestinian land, including lands that would have been \\nclassified as private property, in the West Bank and use it for settlement \\n__________________ \\n \\n30 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, para. 155.  \\n \\n31 Ibid., paras. 173 and 179.  \\n \\n32 Information from the Office of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. \\n \\n33 Ibid. \\n \\n34 S/2023/988, para. 66.  \\n \\n35 OHCHR monitoring. \\n \\n36 Ibid. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/79/347\\n \\n7/20\\n24-16501 \\n \\ndevelopment.37 The International Court of Justice recently stated that “these land \\npolicies are not in conformity with Articles 46, 52 and 55 of the Hague Regulations”.38  \\n24. Israeli authorities declared around 10,800 dunams of land in the West Bank \\n“State land” since the start of 2024, marking a new peak. On 29 February, 2,640.3 \\ndunams were declared “State land” in the Palestinian villages of Abu Dis and \\nel-Azariya, between Ma’ale Adumim and Keidar settlements and in the southern part \\nof the so-called “E1” settlement project. This development places three Palestinian \\ncommunities, (Abu Nuwar, Wadi Abu Al-Suwan, Abu Hindi) and more than 1,000 \\npeople at risk of forcible transfer. On 20 March, an extensive area of 8,000 dunams \\nin the Jordan Valley was declared “State land”,39 the largest such declaration since \\nthe Oslo Accords. On 1 April, the Civil Administration declared as “State land” \\n170 dunams (42 acres) of land surrounding an archaeological site east of Bethlehem \\nand near the Etzion settlement bloc.40  \\n \\nOutposts  \\n \\n25. According to Peace Now, during the reporting period, Israeli settlers established \\n30 new outposts, 22 of them after 7 October. The new outposts follow contiguous \\nlines, fragmenting the land, further diminishing the viability of a Palestinian State. \\nParticularly after 7 October, settlers established new roads, fences and obstacles that \\nreshaped the geography of Area C and the West Bank. 41 Settlers constructed 20 new \\nroads between October and January alone, with many more constructed subsequently. \\nSettlers also erected fences and other obstacles to block Palestinian access to large \\namounts of land, roads and services.  \\n26. While outposts are illegal even under Israeli law, there is a consistent pattern of \\nIsraeli authorities’ involvement, assistance and financing of the construction of \\noutposts,42 as well as their operation,43 and their retroactive “regularization”. For \\nexample, on 2 August, the High Court of Justice of Israel dismissed a petition seeking \\nthe eviction of the illegal Homesh outpost in northern West Bank and restoring \\nPalestinian landowners’ access to their adjacent land. Although the court based its \\ndecision on the grounds that the outpost had been relocated from privately owned \\nPalestinian land,44 access to the relocated outpost still passes through it, thus \\npreventing Palestinians from gaining access to their land. \\n27. OHCHR monitored attacks by settlers from outposts on Palestinian \\ncommunities, which contributed to their displacement. Settlers also appropriated \\nPalestinian land, increasing the risks of permanent displacement and of those \\ncommunities’ forcible transfer. For example, in the Barriyet Tuqu area, settlers \\n__________________ \\n \\n37 A/HRC/52/76, para. 8. \\n \\n38 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, paras. 120 \\nand 122. \\n \\n39 Office of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, “Security Council briefing \\non the situation in the Middle East, report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of UN \\nSCR 2334 (as delivered by Special Coordinator Wennesland)”, 26 March 2024.  \\n \\n40 OHCHR monitoring.  \\n \\n41 OHCHR, “The human rights situation in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem: \\n7 October–20 November 2023”, 27 December 2023, para. 34.  \\n \\n42 OHCHR monitoring.  \\n \\n43 Ibid.

Consolidation of settlements \\n \\n \\nRetroactive regularization of outposts \\n \\n28. In the reporting period, Israeli authorities “legalized” one outpost. On \\n25 February, the Israel Defense Forces Central Command commander signed an order \\nredefining the jurisdiction of “Mishmar Yehuda” outpost near Al-Ubediya, east of \\nBethlehem,45 effectively turning it into a large urban settlement with over 417 dunams \\nof land.46 On 27 March, the Civil Administration announced plans to incorporate the \\nAhiya outpost into the Shilo settlement,47 which would effectively “legalize” the \\noutpost, set up in 1997, under Israeli law.  \\n29. On 20 April, Israeli media reported that the Finance Minister and additional \\nMinister in the Ministry of Defense had instructed various government ministries to \\nallocate budgets and provide services to 68 outposts. 48 This followed a Cabinet \\ndecision49 from February 2023 and coalition agreements to treat outposts as if they \\nwere legal for the purposes of budgets and services and to refrain from enforcing \\ndemolition orders, bypassing legalization procedures. 50  \\n \\n \\n \\nIV. Impact of settlements on human rights \\n \\n \\n30. Israeli military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the \\naccompanying violent attacks and human rights violations perpetrated by Israeli \\nsettlers and Israeli security forces, and the long-standing discriminatory system under \\nwhich Israel exercises control over Palestinians, continued to subvert the rights of the \\nPalestinian people, including their right to self-determination.51 \\n31. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that Israel \\nsubjected the Palestinian people to “long-standing systematic discrimination, \\noppression and violence”.52 The International Court of Justice recently concluded that \\na number of Israeli policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory were \\ninconsistent with the obligations of Israel under international human rights treaties, \\nincluding the prohibition of racial segregation and apartheid under article 3 of the \\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. 53  \\n \\n \\n__________________ \\n \\n45 Information from the Office of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. \\n \\n46 OHCHR monitoring.  \\n \\n47 Ibid.  \\n \\n48 Hagar Shezaf and Jonathan Lis, “Israel’s Finance Minister orders ministries to provide services, \\ninfrastructure to illegal West Bank outposts”, Haaretz, 21 April 2024. \\n \\n49 See www.gov.il/BlobFolder/pmopolicy/dec6b-2023/he/dec-b6150323.pdf. \\n \\n50 OHCHR monitoring.  \\n \\n51 A/HRC/55/144, para. 5; A/78/554, para. 29; A/75/376, paras. 13, 40 and 62; and A/HRC/52/75, \\npara. 2. \\n \\n52 A/HRC/55/72, para. 8. \\n \\n53 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, paras. 154, \\n197, 206, 213, 222, 223, 229 and 238–243. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/79/347\\n \\n9/20\\n24-16501 \\n \\n \\nA. Housing, land and property rights \\n \\n \\nDemolitions, forced evictions and risk of forcible transfer \\n \\n32. Demolitions and seizures of Palestinian-owned structures continued across the \\nWest Bank, including in East Jerusalem. On 19 July, the additional Minister in the \\nMinistry of Defense announced a new border police unit, focusing on the enforcement \\nof planning laws, and the expansion of enforcement to Areas A and B. 54 On 7 April, \\nIsraeli authorities transferred land enforcement authority, which Israel applies also in \\nEast Jerusalem, to the Minister of National Security, 55 who has repeatedly made calls \\nto intensify demolitions of Palestinian structures.  \\n33. Israeli authorities demolished 1,277 Palestinian-owned structures, including \\n459 inhabited residential buildings and 62 donor funded structures. This represents a \\nsharp increase from 1,056 structures demolished and 1,194 displaced in the same \\nperiod between 2022 and 2023, and represents the highest numbers recorded since \\n2009.56  \\n34. Israeli authorities demolished, seized or forced the owners to demolish 913 \\nstructures lacking Israeli-issued building permits, which remain almost impossible \\nfor Palestinians to obtain. The Civil Administration acknowledged that 95 per cent of \\nPalestinian building permit applications in Area C are rejected. Over the past 20 years, \\non average less than 10 permits per year have been granted to Palestinians. 57 \\n35. Israeli authorities demolished at least 10 structures in Area C, under Military \\nOrder 1797, which provides for the demolition of so-called “new” structures. It gives \\nresidents 96 hours’ notice of demolitions and limits legal remedies.58 \\n36. 156 Palestinian communities (comprising 2,664 Palestinians, including 766 \\nmen, 750 women, 579 girls, 593 boys) suffered total or partial displacement. Bedouin \\nand other herding communities were especially affected, with 138 structures \\ndemolished, affecting 999 people and displacing 213 people (47 women, 48 men, 63 \\ngirls, 54 boys). Displacement increased after 7 October: at least 54 Palestinian \\nhouseholds from 12 herding communities, comprising 115 people (26 women, 28 \\nmen, 34 girls, 27 boys) were displaced.  \\n37. Demolitions in East Jerusalem remained of particular concern, particularly \\nfollowing 7 October. Since 7 October, a total of 142 demolitions were undertaken in \\nEast Jerusalem, including 77 of inhabited residential structures. In the three months \\nfollowing 7 October alone, 63 demolitions were undertaken in East Jerusalem, \\nmarking an 85 per cent increase compared with the same period the previous year.  59 \\n38. Displacement and the application of discriminatory laws continued to \\nundermine the rights of Palestinian children to have access to education. 60 On \\n17 August, shortly before the academic year started and following the displacement \\n__________________ \\n \\n54 See https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/committees/foreignaffairs/news/pages/pr190723.aspx. \\n \\n55 See www.gov.il/he/pages/dec1677-2024.

The discriminatory housing, property and planning laws, policies and practices \\nof Israel and the forced evictions arising therefrom, violate international law,62 \\nincluding of Palestinians’ right to adequate housing,63 property, health, education, \\nprivacy, food, water and sanitation, and work. The International Court of Justice \\nrecently concluded that “Israel’s planning policy in relation to the issuance of \\nbuilding permits, and … its practice of property demolition for lack of a building \\npermit, which treats Palestinians differently from settlers without justification, \\namounts to prohibited discrimination, in violation of articles 2, paragraph 1, and 26 \\nof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 2, paragraph 2, of \\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and article 2 of \\nthe International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial \\nDiscrimination”.64  \\n40. Women and girls are particularly affected. Demolitions and forced evictions \\nmake them more vulnerable to gender-based violence when rendered homeless. In \\none case monitored by OHCHR, a female head of household reported facing gender-\\nbased violence while seeking accommodation following her displacement. In other \\ncases, women have reported adverse impacts on their privacy. Women and girls also \\nface increased water and sanitation challenges for menstrual hygiene, pregnancy, \\ndelivery and lactation. In addition, they often bear a higher demand for unpaid care \\nand support work, increasing exposure to gender-based violence.65  \\n41. In its advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice recalled that, “under \\narticle 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the destruction of real or personal \\nproperty is ‘prohibited, except where […] rendered absolutely necessary by military \\noperations’”, an exception that the Court was not convinced applied to these punitive \\ndemolitions.66 The Court further concluded that Israeli “forcible evictions, extensive \\nhouse demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement, often leave little \\nchoice to Palestinians in Area C but to leave” and that Israeli “policies and practices \\nare contrary to the prohibition of forcible transfer of the protected population \\nunder […] article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.”67 \\n \\nEast Jerusalem \\n \\n42. The Israeli authorities advanced the destruction of private property in the \\nneighbourhood of Al-Bustan, Silwan, to create a park beside an illegal Israeli \\nsettlement.

It was within an area designated \\nby Israeli authorities as a “green area” following the unlawful annexation of East \\nJerusalem. Thousands of Palestinians are at risk of forced eviction following planned \\ndemolitions in Silwan, due to Israeli property, planning and zoning laws and policies \\nthat officials apply unlawfully and discriminatorily against Palestinians.69  \\n43. Israeli courts continued to order the eviction of Palestinians in East Jerusalem \\nbased on the application of discriminatory Israeli laws to occupied East Jerusalem. 70 \\nOn 11 April, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from the Shhadeh family, \\nresidents of Batan al-Hawa, Silwan, against a 2022 eviction order.71 The refusal was \\nbased on a claim that the Shhadeh family’s houses had been built on land that, prior \\nto 1948, had been Jewish-owned. The Supreme Court gave the family until 1 June \\n2024 to leave.72 The family are one of 84 Palestinian families in Batan al-Hawa, \\ntotalling 700 people, who face eviction proceedings initiated by a settler organization  \\nin its efforts to control the Silwan neighbourhood. On 15 April, the Israeli Magistrate \\nCourt ordered the eviction of three Palestinian families from their houses in Sheikh \\nJarrah neighbourhood, in favour of a settler real estate company, Nahlat Shimom. 73  \\n44. Israeli authorities accelerated land titling in East Jerusalem. 74 According to \\nIsraeli NGOs that monitor this process, procedures were advanced for at least 215 \\nblocks, each comprising several plots of land and/or buildings. During the reporting \\nperiod, settlement of land title was finalized in 17 blocks, raising to 39 the total \\nnumber of blocks in which the process has been concluded since its inception five/six \\nyears ago.75 According to Ir Amin and Bimkon, in 90 per cent of the 39 cases, the \\nprocess was finalized in favour of Israeli settlers or the Israeli State.  \\n45. For example, authorities advanced the processes in the Armenian Quarter of \\nJerusalem’s Old City after Israeli settlers violently attempted to seize land when a \\ndisputed land deal was cancelled.76 The settlement of land title appears aimed at \\nsolidifying the settlers’ attempted seizure and limited the community’s ability to \\ncontest the deal. \\n46. The land titling process appears to be used to advance new settlements and \\nexpand Israeli control over territory in occupied East Jerusalem. 77 It places thousands \\nof Palestinians across East Jerusalem at risk of forced eviction and forcible transfer. \\nLand titling amounts to application of Israeli domestic laws, with long-term effect, to \\noccupied territory.

Movement restrictions imposed to facilitate settlement life and further \\nsettlement encroachment on Palestinian land continued to render Palestinian \\nlivelihoods unsustainable.79 After 7 October, Israel security forces and settlers \\nincreasingly limited Palestinians’ access to main roads, fields and other villages, \\nwhile facilitating the free movement of settlers, including possible perpetrators of \\nviolence against Palestinians.80 Israeli security forces and settlers closed checkpoints \\nand installed roadblocks to block Palestinians’ movement, particularly those near \\nsettlements and outposts, further limiting their access to farmland. 81  \\n48. For instance, between 7 and 10 October, settlers erected earth mounds blocking \\nthe main point by which the Al-Muntar Bedouin community gains access to the \\nnearest urban centre, As-Sawahira- Ash-Sharqiya. Since then, 100 families from the \\ncommunity have been forced to use a 35-kilometre alternative road to gain access to \\nresources, such as animal feed. The local school, serving 35 students, was forced to \\nclose. In parallel, settlers from nearby Tsan Kidar Farm outpost prevented access to \\nthe community’s fields and grazed their sheep on crops cultivated by the community. \\nAfter legal aid organizations addressed the Civil Administration and petitioned the \\nIsraeli High Court to challenge the closure, Israel Defense Forces Central Command \\nordered the temporary seizure of the road for “security reasons,” allowing the \\nrestrictions to continue. On 25 February, the High Court of Justice endorsed the order \\nuntil 1 July.  \\n49. These movement restrictions caused by the settlement project continue to \\nundermine the social and economic rights by Palestinians in the West Bank. 82 For \\ninstance, the diversion of water supplies from Palestinian villages to settlements \\ninfringed residents’ access to basic amenities, while NGOs reported that run-off \\nsettlement wastewater had an adverse impact on Palestinian farming. \\n \\nSettlements-related violence  \\n \\n50. The situation deteriorated after 7 October, following statements inciting \\ndiscrimination, hostility or violence from multiple Israeli officials. 83 According to the \\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, during the reporting period, \\nIsraeli settlers perpetrated 1,350 attacks against Palestinians causing injuries \\n(including 55 caused by firearms), of which 991 were committed after 7 October.84 \\n__________________ \\n \\n78 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, para. 139. \\n \\n79 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), “UNCTAD report exposes \\neconomic strain on Palestinian welfare in West Bank due to Israeli restrictions”, 28 November \\n2023; International Labour Organization, “Impact of the war in Gaza on the labour market and \\nlivelihoods in the occupied Palestinian Territory”, Bulletin No. 4 (Beirut, 2024). \\n \\n80 Restrictions were already discriminatory before 7 October, see A/77/493, para. 13.  \\n \\n81 OHCHR documented catastrophic impacts on Palestinian communities.

Another 7 (6 men, 1 boy) were killed by either Israeli security forces \\nor settlers, all after 7 October, and 484 were killed by Israeli security forces, also after \\n7 October.85 This violence exacerbates a previously reported trend of rising human \\nrights violations by settlers in recent years.86 \\n51. During the reporting period, 24 Israelis (16 men, 4 boys, 4 women, including \\n1 Palestinian citizen of Israel) were killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, \\ndue to alleged attacks by Palestinians, 14 of whom (9 men, 3 women, 2 boys) were \\nkilled after 7 October. Out of the 24 Israelis killed, 10 were members of the security \\nforces.  \\n52. Settler violence has been enabled by the complicity, acquiescence and support \\nor participation of Israeli security forces. The lack of accountability that settlers enjoy \\nis part of a well-documented State-sanctioned impunity, which in turn accelerated the \\ndisplacement of Palestinians and created new facts on the ground. 87 Amid a marked \\nincrease in incitement by Israeli authorities following the 7 October attacks, 88 some \\nIsraeli officials appeared to condone and encourage settler violence, 89 even urging \\nsettlement as a purported response to violence by individual Palestinians. 90 \\n53. Thousands of settlers from “settlements defence squads”, many with a history \\nof attacks against Palestinians, have been drafted into regional army battalion units \\nsince 7 October,91 stoking a trend of significant attacks by known settlers armed and \\nin Israeli military uniform.92 This has been accompanied by State supply of weapons \\nto “settlement defence squads”,93 contributing to increased violence against \\nPalestinians. OHCHR monitored dozens of incidents of harassment and attack of \\nPalestinians by members of Israeli security forces known to be settlers.  \\n54.

Moreover, 93.7 per cent of all \\ninvestigations were closed without an indictment, and only 9 of the 107 indictments \\nsecured a conviction.95 Of the 1,437 cases where Israeli police gave reasons for \\nclosing investigations, 64 per cent were because the offender was “unknown” and 20 \\n__________________ \\n \\n85 Overall, Israeli security forces killed 562 Palestinians in the West Bank, including East \\nJerusalem during the reporting period.  \\n \\n86 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “UN and partners assess \\nurgent humanitarian needs of herding communities in the occupied Palestinian Territory amid \\nincreased Israeli settler violence”, 4 August 2023. \\n \\n87 OHCHR, “The human rights situation in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem: \\n7 October–20 November 2023”. \\n \\n88 A/HRC/55/28, paras. 50 and 69; and OHCHR, “The human rights situation in the occupied West \\nBank including East Jerusalem: 7 October–20 November 2023”. \\n \\n89 OHCHR monitoring.

Case study: displacement of herding communities \\n \\n \\n55. Bedouin and other herding communities have been especially vulnerable to \\nsettler attacks aimed at taking over large swathes of Area C, causing displacement of \\ncommunities in unprecedented numbers during the reporting period. Violence, threats \\nof violence and the application of discriminatory property and planning laws create a \\nclimate of fear and intimidation that has compelled persons in multiple communities \\nto abandon their homes, lands and communities. In total, 267 households comprising \\n1,623 people, including 777 children, were displaced; of those, 233 households \\ncomprising 1,395 people, including 659 children, were displaced after 7 October.97 \\n56. The cases below demonstrate the trends monitored by OHCHR. Settlers, \\nincreasingly armed with firearms, have conducted an organized campaign targeted at \\nBedouin and herding communities south and east of the West Bank central mountain \\nrange. They attack and intimidate communities at gunpoint, demand that they leave \\ntheir homes and lands, and impose restrictions interfering with their livelihood and \\naccess to basic necessities. Settlers encroach on Palestinian land and prevent \\ncultivation or grazing, including by deploying drones and vehicles to scare and scatter \\nlivestock, stealing and killing livestock and damaging farm property. Settler takeover \\nof Palestinian grazing areas has led to the displacement of numerous communities. 98 \\n57. The displacement of Palestinian communities is accompanied and driven by the \\nestablishment of settler outposts on Palestinian land. Eleven shepherding outposts, \\namassing 100,000 dunams, are estimated to have been constructed between 7 October \\nand end of April.99  \\n58. The displacement of Bedouin and other herding communities is facilitated by \\ndiscriminatory Israeli property and planning processes. For example, following settler \\ndestruction of herder structures, planning legislation is cited by the Civil \\nAdministration to prohibit displaced communities from rebuilding structures in Area \\nC,100 making their return impossible and their displacement permanent. \\nSimultaneously, the State expropriates land for the benefit of Israeli settlers. For \\nexample, the declaration of 2,640.3 dunams101 as “State land” will effectively displace \\nmultiple Bedouin communities in favour of Israeli settlements.  \\n59. Israeli security forces have accompanied, supported or participated in many \\nattacks on herder communities, for example by shooting at Palestinians or seizing \\nPalestinian livestock,102 contributing to the displacement of herding communities. \\nIsraeli security forces have also supported and participated in the takeover of \\nPalestinian land and the construction of outposts. In addition, they have obstructed \\n__________________ \\n \\n96 Ibid., p. 9. \\n \\n97 Compare with “over 1000” herders reportedly displaced by settler violence between the \\nbeginning of 2022 and end of May 2023, see A/78/554, para. 43.

OHCHR has monitored multiple \\ncases in which Israeli security forces cite “state of war” for declining to aid \\ncommunities facing settler violence and to justify closures of vital roads. \\n \\nKhirbet Zanuta  \\n \\n60. Khirbet Zanuta, in the south Hebron hills, is an established non-refugee, \\nnon-Bedouin herding community that represents the last Palestinian herder \\ncommunity in a band of growing settler-controlled land in Area C of south Hebron. \\nIsraeli settlers have allegedly strategically targeted herders, with the apparent \\nintention of forcing them to leave.106 Their displacement consolidates the settlers’ \\npresence, while preventing Palestinian access to huge swathes of herding land.  \\n61. Residents suffered five attacks between 12 and 28 October, including physical \\nassault of children and women by armed settlers, as well as threats to kill their whole \\nfamilies. According to the head of the village council, violence and threats against \\nthe community forced more than 30 families of 250 people, including some 100 \\nchildren, to leave the village between 28 October and 2 November. They have been \\nunable to return to their homes, and the displacement risks becoming permanent.  \\n62. Israeli settlers installed fences and dismantled the remaining infrastructure, \\nimpeding the residents’ return, destroying 10 structures by 10 December, including \\nthe donor-funded Zanuta Mixed School on 22 November.107 Settlers maintained an \\nunwavering presence in Zanuta, marking the site with Israeli flags and graffiti, 108 and \\npreventing residents from visiting or harvesting their olives. 109  \\n63. Israeli authorities have directly contributed to preventing the Zanuta community \\nfrom returning by designating the site a “closed military zone” and prohibiting the \\nrebuilding of destroyed structures on account of a lack of building permits. 110 On \\n2 May, following a petition on behalf of residents of Zanuta, the High Court of Justice \\nordered the State to specify measures intended to ensure the return of the residents, \\ntheir safety and the security of their property and livestock, in addition to \\naccountability measures related to previous attacks.111 \\n \\nTuqu’ wilderness  \\n \\n64.

On 15 October, armed Israeli settlers, accompanied by Israeli \\nsecurity forces, demolished one agricultural property and occupied another. On \\n17 October, a group of armed settlers on quadbikes threw stones at four herders and \\nchased them away, threatening to kill the herders if they saw them again. On \\n23 October, settlers vandalized and stole a family’s property, looting equipment and \\nbulldozing two animal sheds.  \\n66. Displaced community members told OHCHR that they fled with their livestock, \\nleaving their homes and farming infrastructure. Of the last eight families displaced, \\nfour are staying with residents of Sa’ir, while four have relocated to Tuqu’ village, \\nwhere pastureland scarcity renders grazing impossible. The attacks and displacement \\nhave devastated displaced residents, exacerbated by a lost olive harvest, destruction \\nof farmland and death of livestock. One resident remarked that “the future is \\nunpredictable” and that they risk losing their “main source of income.” \\n67. Settlers and Israeli security forces appear to have acted in concert to prevent \\nresidents’ return. OHCHR observed that settlers had destroyed infrastructure 112 and \\nfarming equipment, including a network of donor-funded water pipes connecting the \\nwilderness with the Tuqu’ Municipality, while simultaneously installing caravans, \\nroads and electricity links to the Teko’a and Nikodim settlements. Between 7 October \\nand 11 May, according to Kerem Navot, settlers built at least four new outposts 113 and \\nfour new roads on Palestinian land in Tuqu’, appropriating more than 550 acres, \\nmaking it the largest such seizure by a single Israeli settlement (Teko’a).114 In tandem \\nwith State-supported violence, on 1 April, Israeli authorities declared 171 dunams \\nsurrounding the nearby Herodion archaeological site as “State land”.115 \\n \\nAl-Mu’arrajat \\n \\n68. Al-Mu’arrajat community in the Jordan Valley is also at risk of displacement. \\nThis Bedouin community of the Kaabneh tribe, comprises three villages totalling 250 \\nPalestinians, situated between the lowlands of the Jericho governorate, northeast of \\nJericho and the highlands northwest of Jericho, on both sides of the Al-Mu’arrajat \\nroad in Area C.  \\n69. Settlers from Mevot Yorihu settlement have attacked Palestinians, throwing \\nstones at them and subjecting them to insults and threats, as part of a harassment \\npattern. On 26 October, Israeli settlers reportedly placed dolls, doused with red dye \\nto imitate blood, on the doors of the Arab Al-Kaabna School. When these same dolls \\nwere used again in a settler attack on 23 January to adorn three settler-built mock \\nchild graves116 120 metres from the Al-Kaabna school, it sparked “intense fear” \\namong residents.117 Settlers have killed and stolen sheep, affecting herders’ \\n__________________ \\n \\n112 There are around 100 cisterns in the wilderness, many of them have been vandalized by the \\nsettlers.  \\n \\n113 On file with the office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory of OHCHR.  \\n \\n114 Ben Hubbard, “In the West Bank, guns and a locked gate signal town’s new residents”, New York \\nTimes, 1 June 2024.  \\n \\n115 On file with the office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory of OHCHR. \\n \\n116 OHCHR monitoring.

On 31 January, an Israeli settler from the Zohar outpost ran over 12 sheep \\nbelonging to a community official, before stealing 10 others. Israeli security forces \\nprovided armed support to settler violations, for example, by supervising the grazing \\nof settler-owned sheep on Palestinian land. On 11 March, a new pastoral outpost was \\nbeing established, comprising an area cordoned off using poles and chicken-wire \\nfencing, and a small tarpaulin structure.118  \\n70. The intensity of the takeover, violence and threats against the Al-Mu’arrajat \\ncommunity have caused the residents in Al-Mu’arrajat centre to flee to Al-Mu’arrajat \\nEast, leaving Al-Mu’arrajat centre completely empty. Nevertheless, Al Mu’arrjat East \\ncontinues to be targeted, threatening the displacement from the entire Al-Mu’arrajat \\nlands.  \\n71. Systematic and increasingly severe settler violence contributed to a worsening \\ncoercive environment, threatening Palestinian displacement from areas to which they \\nhave traditionally been tied.119 Israel, as the occupying Power, has an obligation to \\nrestore and ensure public order and civil life, while respecting the laws in force in the \\noccupied territory, as well as international human rights law. 120 Evidence that the \\nIsraeli security forces and Civil Administration have deliberately impeded Palestinian \\ncommunities’ attempts to return to their homes raise concerns with respect to the \\nIsraeli security forces’ support and approval of the displacement and an intention that \\nthe displacement be permanent. The International Court of Justice recently found that \\nsettler violence against Palestinians, impunity for settlers and the excessive use of \\nState force against Palestinians contribute to “a coercive environment” and that \\n“Israel’s systematic failure to prevent or to punish” such activity contravenes its \\nobligations under article 46 of the Hague Regulations, article 27 (1) of the Fourth \\nGeneva Convention, and articles 6 (1) and 7 of the International Covenant on Civil \\nand Political Rights.121  \\n \\n \\n \\nV. Settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan  \\n \\n \\n72. Settlement expansion in the occupied Syrian Golan continued with the support \\nof the Government of Israel. The General Assembly has recently reaffirmed that “the \\nIsraeli settlements…in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal.”122 The expansion \\ninvolved both an increase in the number of Israeli settlements and the Israeli settler \\npopulation, as well as the advancement of commercial activities, 123 including the \\napproval of the construction of a wind turbine project. 124 These measures align with \\nthe plan of Israel to double the settler population in the occupied Syrian Golan by \\n2027,125 with settlers already outnumbering the local Syrian population. 126 Israeli \\nsettlers in the occupied Syrian Golan are currently distributed across 35 different \\nsettlements.127 \\n73. On 20 June 2023, Israel began work on a wind turbines near Majdal Shams and \\nMas’adah in the occupied Syrian Golan.

The construction may also have potentially detrimental impacts on the \\npopulation’s health and environment,131 including soil fertility and noise pollution. 132 \\nThese potential environmental impacts, along with the loss of land near the turbines, \\ncould threaten the community’s health and livelihoods by further limiting the Syrian \\npopulation’s access to agricultural land and water.133 It could also restrict the villages’ \\nability to expand, forcing residents into densely populated areas. 134 Farmers in \\nparticular could face the dual challenge of losing land to cultivate while already \\nstruggling to compete with subsidized settlement agriculture. 135 The project could \\nthereby affect a wide range of human rights, including the rights to adequate food, \\nwork and health, and the right to adequate housing,136 potentially leading to displacing \\nthe Syrian population from areas to which they have traditionally been tied. The \\nGeneral Assembly “condemn[ed]…any activities involving the confiscation of land, \\nthe disruption of the livelihood of protected persons, the forced transfer of civilians \\nand the annexation of land, whether de facto or through national legislation”.137  \\n \\n \\n \\nVI. Conclusions and recommendations  \\n \\n \\n74. The establishment and continuing expansion of Israeli settlements in the \\nOccupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan amount to the \\ntransfer by Israel of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it \\noccupies, which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, as \\nconfirmed by the International Court of Justice.138 It may also amount to a war \\ncrime.139 \\n75. The International Court of Justice further concluded recently that “[t]he \\nexpansion of Israel’s settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is based \\non the confiscation or requisitioning of large areas of land” and that “these land \\npolicies are not in conformity with articles 46, 52 and 55 of the Hague \\nRegulations”. In particular, settlement of land title, as practiced in East \\n__________________ \\n \\n128 A/HRC/55/72, para. 49. \\n \\n129 Times of Israel staff, “Work on Golan wind turbines that sparked unrest expected to resume next \\nweek”, The Times of Israel, 25 August 2023; Troy O.

The Court also held the following:  \\nIsrael’s policies and practices, including the maintenance and expansion of \\nsettlements, the construction of associated infrastructure, including the \\nwall, the exploitation of natural resources, the proclamation of Jerusalem \\nas Israel’s capital, the comprehensive application of Israeli domestic law in \\nEast Jerusalem and its extensive application in the West Bank, entrench \\nIsrael’s control of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, notably of East \\nJerusalem and of Area C of the West Bank [and] amount to annexation of \\nlarge parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.141  \\nThe transfer of wide administrative powers relating to settlements and land \\nadministration from the military authorities to Israeli civilians, erasing the \\ndistinct administration of the occupied territory, further facilitates the process \\nof annexation, in violation of international law, including the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations.  \\n77. The Secretary-General reiterates his strong condemnation of the horrific \\nattacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Israel on 7 October \\n2023 and the continued holding of hostages in Gaza. The scope of death and \\ndestruction in Gaza as a result of the war that ensued has been unprecedented \\nand horrifying. He unequivocally condemns the widespread killing and maiming \\nof civilians in Gaza, including women and children. He reiterates his call for an \\nimmediate ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all the \\nhostages.  \\n78. The increase in settler violence, especially after 7 October 2023, with the \\nparticipation and support of Israeli security forces and continuing widespread \\nimpunity, highlights the unwillingness of the Israeli authorities to uphold the \\nobligations of Israel under the law of occupation, including the obligation to \\nrespect family honour and rights, the lives of persons and private property in \\noccupied territory.142 Settler violence adversely affects the enjoyment of the \\nrights of Palestinian people, including the rights to security of person, freedom \\nof movement, privacy, family life, an adequate standard of living, work and \\neducation. It is a manifestly important factor in the coercive environment that \\nforces many Palestinians to leave their homes.  \\n79. Systematic demolition of Palestinian homes, on the basis of discriminatory \\nlaws and policies, is ongoing and results in forced evictions. Forced evictions \\nresulting from demolitions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are a key factor \\nin the creation of a coercive environment. They have a negative impact on a wide \\nrange of human rights, with an exacerbated impact on women and girls, and \\nincrease the risk of forcible transfer. \\n80. There was an almost total failure to ensure accountability for apparent \\nunlawful killing of Palestinians, including in instances that raise concerns of \\nextrajudicial executions and wilful killing. This is indicative of the climate of \\n__________________ \\n \\n140 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, paras. 120 \\nand 122. \\n \\n141 Ibid., para. 173 \\n \\n142 Hague Regulations, art. 46. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nA/79/347 \\n \\n24-16501\\n20/20 \\n \\nimpunity that prevails with respect to excessive force against Palestinians by \\nIsraeli security forces, including in the contexts of settlement. \\n81. The Secretary-General recalls Security Council resolution 2334 (2016), in \\nwhich the Council reaffirmed that the Israeli settlement policy in the Occupied \\nPalestinian Territory is a major obstacle to achieving a two-State solution and a \\njust, lasting and comprehensive peace. He also notes that the International Court \\nof Justice has held in this regard that the State of Israel is under an obligation to \\ncease immediately all new settlement activities and to evacuate all settlers from \\nthe Occupied Palestinian Territory. \\n82. The Secretary-General recalls Security Council resolution 497 (1981), \\nwhereby the Council decided that the decision by Israel to impose its laws, \\njurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights was null \\nand void and without international legal effect, and also recalls General \\nAssembly resolutions reaffirming that the Israeli settlements in the occupied \\nSyrian Golan are illegal.143 \\n83. The Secretary-General calls on Israel to: \\n \\n(a) \\nImmediately and completely cease and reverse all settlement activities \\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in compliance \\nwith international law and relevant United Nations resolutions, such as Security \\nCouncil resolution 2334 (2016); \\n \\n(b) \\nImmediately halt demolitions and forced evictions of the Palestinian \\npopulation and cease any activity that would further contribute to a coercive \\nenvironment and/or otherwise contribute to forcible transfer; \\n \\n(c) \\nIn line with its obligations as the occupying Power, issue clear and \\nunambiguous orders to Israeli security forces to ensure the protection of the \\nPalestinian population against settler violence and hold to account members of \\nthe Israeli security forces who fail to comply with such orders;  \\n \\n(d) \\nEnsure that all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli security \\nforces against Palestinians, including gender-based violence, and damage to their \\nhomes and property are promptly, effectively, thoroughly and transparently \\ninvestigated; that perpetrators are prosecuted and, if convicted, punished with \\nappropriate sanctions; and that victims are provided with effective remedies, \\nincluding adequate compensation, access to justice, support and protection \\nservices, in accordance with international standards; \\n \\n(e) \\nImmediately cease and reverse all settlement development and related \\nactivities in the occupied Syrian Golan and end discriminatory land, housing and \\ndevelopment policies, in compliance with relevant United Nations resolutions. \\n84. The Secretary-General further recommends that all States take all \\nmeasures necessary and consistent with international law to effectively ensure \\nrespect for applicable international law. \\n \\n__________________ \\n \\n143 General Assembly resolution 78/78. \\n\"}"

Introduction  \n \n \n1. \nThe present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/126 \nand provides an update on the implementation of the resolution from 1 June 2022 to \n31 May 2023. It is based on direct monitoring and information-gathering conducted \nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) \nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and on information provided by Government \nsources, United Nations entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The \nreport should be read in conjunction with related reports of the Secretary-General and \nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted to the General \nAssembly and the Human Rights Council.1 \n2. \nThe report contains an update on settlement advancement and its impact on the \nhuman rights of the Palestinian people. Section IV highlights settlement expansion \nand settler violence as key human rights violations against Palestinians in the West \nBank, with a focus on the Nablus area. It also contains an update on Israeli settlements \nin the occupied Syrian Golan. \n \n \n \nII. Legal background \n \n \n3. \nBoth international human rights law and international humanitarian law \nconcurrently apply in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, namely, Gaza and the West \nBank, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. This includes the \napplication of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons \nin Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention), which is binding upon Israel as the \noccupying Power. A detailed analysis of the applicable legal framework can be found \nin previous reports of the Secretary-General.2 \n \n \n \nIII. Update on settlement activities \n \n \n4. \nOver the past decade, successive Israeli Governments have consistently \nadvanced and implemented policies of settlement expansion and takeover of \nPalestinian land.3 \n5. \nThe policies of the current Government in this regard are aligned, to an \nunprecedented extent, with the goals of the Israeli settler movement to expand long-\nterm control over the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and, in practice, \nto further integrate those areas into the territory of the State of Israel. The \nGovernment, in its guiding principles, expressly claimed the “exclusive and \nindisputable right” of the Jewish people to “all parts of the Land of Israel”, including \nthe occupied West Bank and the occupied Syrian Golan. 4 In addition, Coalition \nagreements indicated that the Government would promote a policy of “application of \nsovereignty” over the West Bank 5  through institutional changes, legislation and \nmassive settlement expansion, including the regularization of outposts. 6 Any acts or \npolicies amounting to a purported annexation of the occupied territories, if \n__________________ \n \n1  See A/78/502; A/HRC/52/75; and A/HRC/52/76. \n \n2  See A/HRC/34/38; and A/HRC/34/39. \n \n3  A/HRC/52/76, para. 2. \n \n4 See Government of Israel coalition agreements, on file with the Office of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). \n \n5  See article 118 of the coalition agreement between the Prime Minister and the Religious Zionism \nparty, on file with OHCHR.  \n \n6  Ibid., see for example, arts. 142–199. \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554\n \n3/20\n23-20717 \n \nimplemented, would constitute a most serious violation of international law, including \nthe Charter of the United Nations.7 \n6. \nBy 31 May, the agenda of the Government was advancing at a fast pace. Ahead \nof the formation of the Government, the Knesset amended the Basic Law: the \nGovernment so as to allow the creation of an Additional Minister post within the \nMinistry of Defence.8 The founder of the settler organization Regavim and leader of \nthe far-right Religious Zionism party, who resides in the settlement of Kedumim, was \nappointed as Additional Minister. 9 While the Minister of Defence retains security \npowers, the Additional Minister, formally under the supervision of the Minister of \nDefence, assumes administrative functions pertaining to the majority of the governing \npowers in the West Bank, including land designations, planning and coordination of \ndemolitions.10 Among other responsibilities, the Additional Minister will supervise a \nnewly created and staffed Settlement Administration unit 11  and be in charge of \nmanaging and directing the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories \nunit and the Civil Administration of Israel; regularizing settlements; implementing an \n“equal citizenship reform” in the West Bank aimed at improving services and \ninfrastructure for settlers only; and updating “security legislation”, that is to say, \nimplementing the reform through military orders. 12  On 18 May, the Additional \nMinister, in his other capacity as Minister of Finance, reportedly presented to \nGovernment ministries a two-year plan under which 500,000 more settlers would \nmove to the occupied West Bank13 and, to that end, budget allocations to several other \ncivilian ministries would be increased14 according to media, a senior Israeli Minister \nlater clarified that the proposal of the Additional Minister did not represent \ngovernment policy.15 \n7. \nThese measures, in particular the transfer of wide administrative powers relating \nto settlements and land administration from the military authorities to Israeli civilians, \nelected and accountable to the population of Israel, could facilitate annexation in \nviolation of international law, including the Charter. Moreover, the changes explicitly \nreflect the facts on the ground, namely, that Israel has been administering the occupied \nWest Bank in a manner that discriminates against the protected population. 16 \n__________________ \n \n7  Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations \nconcerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 18 October 1907 (Hague Regulations), \narts. 42–43, 46 and 55–56; Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in \nTime of War of 12 August 1949 (Fourth Geneva Convention), arts. 47, 53 and 64; and A/75/376, \npara. 13. \n \n8 Israel, Basic Law: The Government, Article 24a (Amendment No.11), on file with OHCHR.

Settlement expansion \n \n \n \n \nAdvancement, including planning and tenders  \n \n9. \nAdvancement of plans for settlement construction increased. 19 Plans for the \nconstruction of some 16,500 housing units were advanced or approved, of which \n11,400 are in Area C and 5,090 are in East Jerusalem, an increase of 58 per cent and \n154 per cent, respectively.20 \n10. Israeli authorities issued tenders for approximately 1,350 new settlement \nhousing units (1,260 in Area C and 90 in East Jerusalem). In Area C alone, a total of \n1,240 settlement construction starts were officially recorded in the period between \n1 July 2022 and 31 March 2023. \n11. \nPlans to consolidate the ring of settlements that will encircle East Jerusalem and \nseparate it from other parts of the West Bank were further developed. Discussion of \nobjections to the construction of over 3,400 housing units between East Jerusalem \nand Ma‘ale Adummim (the E1 area), one of the steps for the final approval of the \nplan, was scheduled for September, but was postponed to March. It was then \npostponed again and is now scheduled to occur by 12 June 2023.21 If implemented, \nthis plan would sever the connection between the northern and southern West Bank \nand eliminate the possibility of a viable and contiguous Palestinian State. 22 \n12. In the southern part of East Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities advanced plans on \n5 September for some 700 units in the new settlement of Givat Hashaked, adjacent to \nthe Palestinian neighbourhoods of Sharafat and Bayt Safafa. 23 On 29 March, the \nJerusalem Local Planning Committee rejected objections to the “Lower Aqueduct” \nplan,24 which envisages the building of 1,465 housing units between the settlements \nof Har Homa and Givat Hamatos. If approved and implemented, the four settlements \nwould create a contiguous built-up belt, sealing off East Jerusalem from Bethlehem. \n13. On 23 November, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected a petition 25 filed by \nPalestinian farmers and Israeli human rights organizations against the allocation of \n1,200 dunums of land in Khirbat al-Nahlah, near Bethlehem, for the planning of up \nto 7,000 housing units in the new settlement of Givat Eitam (the E2 project).

The establishment and expansion of settlements in the West Bank, including \nEast Jerusalem, have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of \ninternational law, including relevant United Nations resolutions. 27  The Israeli \nregulations, policies and practices affecting the Palestinians as described in the \npresent report cumulatively create a coercive environment that is forcing Palestinians \nto leave their homes and lands in what could amount to forcible transfer, which itself \nis a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention that may amount to a war crime. 28  \n \n \n \nRetroactive regularization of outposts \n \n15. In the reporting period, Kerem Navot, an Israeli NGO, documented the \nestablishment of 25 new outposts by settlers in the West Bank.29 Outposts are settler \nconstructions in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, that are also illegal under \nIsraeli law. As the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has stated, \nthe Israeli authorities have employed multiple mechanisms to make it possible to \nretroactively legalize outposts under Israeli law, and make them a tool for settlement \nexpansion and takeover of large areas of Palestinian land.30 \n16. In July, the Supreme Court of Israel reversed a High Court of Justice ruling \nordering the evacuation of settlers from the outpost of Mitzpeh Kramim, near \nRamallah, establishing a potentially concerning precedent for the retroactive \nregularization of dozens of outposts and thousands of illegal structures. 31  The \nSupreme Court ruling changed the legal framework that has been applied to the West \nBank thus far, which prohibited the establishment of Israeli settlements on privately \nowned Palestinian land. 32 Under international humanitarian law, private property \ncannot be confiscated and the destruction of private property is permissible only if it \nis rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. 33 \n17. On 12 February, the Security Cabinet of Israel announced that it had decided to \nretroactively legalize 10 outposts in Area C.34 According to Peace Now, an Israeli \nNGO, six of the outposts are partially built on privately owned Palestinian land. Three \nof the legalized outposts are partially located within Israeli-designated firing zones.35 \n__________________ \n \n26 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “Shrinking space: urban \ncontraction and rural fragmentation in the Bethlehem governorate”, Special Focus, May 2009. \n \n27  Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 49(6); Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the \nOccupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.

In addition to approving plans to build 7,200 housing units in West Bank \nsettlements, in February, the Israeli authorities regularized four additional outposts as \nneighbourhoods of existing settlements, 36  despite the lack of spatial contiguity \nbetween them. 37 Israeli media reported that the Israeli Government has plans to \nregularize 70 additional outposts.38 \n19. These regularization procedures apply only to Israeli construction in the West \nBank. No similar endeavours have been undertaken by the Israeli authorities to \nlegalize Palestinian construction lacking Israeli-issued permits, which are, as a \npractical matter, almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain because of restrictions \nplaced by Israeli policies. Those restrictions lead to discrimination against \nPalestinians in land allocation and planning procedures.  \n20. Israeli authorities have taken actions, including changes to legislation, that \npaved the way to the legalization of the Homesh outpost and the re-establishment of \na settlement that had been evacuated in 2005. In March, the Knesset partially repealed \nthe 2005 Disengagement Law, effectively ending the ban on Israelis entering and \nresiding in Homesh and three other evacuated settlements located deep north in the \nWest Bank. Despite the ban, settlers had built a yeshiva outpost on private Palestinian \nland.39 For years, the Palestinian landowners waited for the outpost to be evacuated \nso that they could gain to access their lands. 40 However, on 2 January, the State \nreversed commitments that it made previously to evacuate the outpost and announced \nthat it would amend existing laws and regularize the outpost. Settlers living in the \noutpost have continued to regularly engage in violence and intimidation against \nPalestinians from the adjacent village of Burqah.41 In May, the Israeli military signed \ntwo military orders, one lifting the ban under military law on entering the outpost and \nanother granting the Samaria Regional Council, a settlement body, jurisdiction over \nseveral plots of State land near Homesh. Overnight on 29 May, settlers relocated the \nyeshiva to designated State land.42 In so doing, they removed one legal argument \nagainst a potential bid to regularize the outpost, namely, that it had been built on \nprivate Palestinian land. The moving of the outpost will require further seizure of \nprivately owned Palestinian land to pave a road for settlers to reach the settlement at \nthe new site.43 \n \n \n \nB. Consolidation of settlements \n \n \n \n \nSettlement of land title \n \n21. In occupied East Jerusalem, Israeli authorities further advanced the process of \nsettlement of land title, with a view to establishing land ownership registration in a \nfinal manner. According to Israeli NGOs that monitor this process, as at 31 May, the \nprocess had been initiated in some 199 blocks, each of which includes several plots \n__________________ \n \n36 See S/PV.9263. \n \n37 Yesh Din, “The age of regularization”, p. 23.

The settlement of land title appears to be used to increase Israeli control over \nadditional territory in occupied East Jerusalem. In particular, it appears to be aimed \nat areas slated for settlement expansion or new settlement construction (such as Atarot \nalong the northern flank of East Jerusalem, Givat Hamatos and Givat Shaked in the \nsouthern part of East Jerusalem); areas where Jewish ownership claims have been \nadvanced over Palestinian land; and areas where the process could lead to the \ndeclaration of Palestinian property as “absentee” based on the Absentee Property Law \nand handed over to the Custodian of Absentee Property. For example, in the Wadi \nHulwah area of Silwan, a Palestinian neighbourhood next to the Old City of Jerusalem \nthat has been targeted for settlement expansion, settlement of title was initiated in 13 \nblocks covering some 95 per cent of buildings or sites taken over by settlers. 45  \n23. The finalization of this process would have enormous implications, placing \nthousands of Palestinians at risk of forced eviction and forcible transfer.  \n \n \n \nInfrastructure development \n \n24. Israeli authorities continued to expand roads and infrastructure connecting and \nsuburbanizing settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, a practice that \nentrenches control over occupied Palestinian land and promotes settlement \nexpansion.46  \n25. According to a media report, the Israeli Government allocated 25 per cent of the \nbudget of the Ministry of Transport for 2023–2024, amounting to 3.5 billion new \nIsraeli shekels (some $972 million), to a five-year development plan to build new \nroads and upgrade existing ones serving settlements in the West Bank. 47 The plan \ncontinues the pursuit of three long-standing strategic goals: strengthening “lateral \ncorridors”, which connect Israeli cities and settlements east-west and fragment north-\nsouth Palestinian contiguity; completing bypass roads that allow settlers to commute \nmore easily while avoiding passing through Palestinian towns; and developing and \nannexing the settlement of Ma‘ale Adummim.48 \n26. Under The plan, 30 million new Israeli shekels (more than $8 million) are \nallocated for the advancement of the “Fabric of Life” road, to the east of Jerusalem, \nthat is intended to be used exclusively by Palestinians. The road would divert \nPalestinian traffic between the southern and central West Bank away from the road \nconnecting the Ma‘ale Adummim settlement and Jerusalem and lead, through an \nunderpass, to the “Eastern Ring Road”, where Israeli and Palestinian traffic is already \nseparated by a wall. The project would allow the checkpoint controlling access to \nJerusalem from the east to be moved further into the West Bank and make the Ma‘ale \nAdummim settlement contiguous with Israel. 49  The land for the planned road, \n__________________ \n \n44 Data from Ir Amim and Bimkom. \n \n45 Ir Amim and Bimkom, “The grand land theft”, June 2023.  \n \n46 Breaking the Silence, “Highway to annexation: Israeli road and transportation infrastructure \ndevelopment in the West Bank”, December 2020. \n \n47 Jeremy Sharon, “Budget dedicated billions for West Bank roads, settlements and illegal \noutposts”, 25 May 2023; www.gov.il/he/Departments/news/09-08-2023 (Hebrew); and \nwww.gov.il/he/departments/news/mot_budget_23-24 (Hebrew). \n \n48 Breaking the Silence, “Highway to annexation”. \n \n49  Hagar Shazaf, “Road for Palestinians in strategic West Bank area”, Haaretz, 2 May 2023. \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554 \n \n23-20717\n8/20 \n \nincluding significant portions located in Area B, was requisitioned in December 2016 \nfor “military needs”.50 \n27. Nearly 2 billion new Israeli shekels were allocated to upgrade and reroute \nRoad 60, the main north-south traffic artery, including finalization of a section \nbypassing the Palestinian town of Huwwarah, in the area of Nablus (see para. 58 \nbelow). While all Israeli settlements along Road 60 have direct access to the road, the \npopulation of many Palestinian localities must use long detours in order to use it.  \n28. The construction of roads designed to connect and serve settlements requires \nextensive confiscation of Palestinian land, uprooting of trees and crops, and changes \nto the local geography and economy that violate the human rights of Palestinians, \nsuch as the right to property and adequate standard of living, including by damaging \nor destroying their livelihoods. Such roads limit the possibilities for Palestinian \ncommunities to grow and often make travel between Palestinian communities more \nonerous.51  \n \n \n \nIV. Impact of settlements on human rights \n \n \n29. More than 56 years of Israeli military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian \nTerritory – the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza – and continued \nexpansion of settlements over Palestinian land have severely affected a wide range of \nthe Palestinian people’s rights, including the right to self-determination.52  \n \n \n \nA. Housing, land and property rights \n \n \n30. In parallel with the expansion of settlements and infrastructure for settlers, Israel \nimplements extremely restrictive and discriminatory planning policies aimed at \ncontaining Palestinians in Areas A and B of the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.  \n31. Israeli demolition of Palestinian properties sharply increased during the \nreporting period. The year 2022 saw the greatest number of homes demolished since \n2016. 53 The Israeli authorities, citing lack of building permits, which are almost \nimpossible to obtain, demolished, confiscated or sealed 1,000 Palestinian-owned \nstructures, including 145 donor-funded structures, across the occupied West Bank, \nincluding East Jerusalem, resulting in the forcible eviction and displacement of 1,020 \nPalestinians (263 men, 235 women and 520 children), and loss of livelihood and \nservices for tens of thousands of others. 54  The greatest numbers of structures \ndemolished were in Area C (815) and in East Jerusalem (181, including 78 structures \nself-demolished by their owners to avoid paying fines and charges).55  \n \n \n \nArea C \n \n32. Area C represents 60 per cent of the occupied West Bank, including most of its \nresources, and remains under full Israeli control.

At least 39 structures in Area C were demolished based on Military Order \n1797,58 which provides only a 96-hour notice and extremely limited legal grounds to \nchallenge the demolition orders. This order, in principle, allows the demolition of \nboth Palestinian and Israeli structures deemed as “new”. Since the order came into \nforce in 2019 and until the first half of 2020, five times more demolition orders were \nissued for Palestinian structures than Israeli ones. Considering the extensive \nunlicensed construction in settlements and outposts, the figures indicate \ndiscriminatory application of the order against Palestinians. 59  \n34. Israeli authorities demolished two schools in Area C. 60 On 7 May, the Civil \nAdministration of Israel demolished, for the second time, a school serving 40 students \nin Jubbit al-Dhib, east of Bethlehem, following a petition by the settler organization \nRegavim. An Israeli court ordered the demolition of the school on the grounds that it \nwas built without permit and unsafe for students. Reportedly, Israeli authorities had \npreviously rejected a planning scheme for the village under which the renovation of \nthe school would have been allowed.61 As at 31 May, at least 50 Palestinian schools \nin Area C and 8 in East Jerusalem, serving around 6,500 students, were at risk of \nimpending demolition.62 \n35. In May, the Ministry of Settlements and National Missions of Israel announced \nthat it would double budget allocations for the “land departments” of settlement \ncouncils to hire additional patrol units and purchase such equipment as drones in order \nto monitor and report unauthorized Palestinian construction to the Civil \nAdministration.63 According to a media report, when funding for these efforts began \nin 2022, an Israeli minister stated they were aimed at countering “the takeover” of \nArea C by Palestinians, an argument often used not to allow Palestinian \nconstruction.64  \n \n \n \nHebron (H2 area)  \n \n36. Israeli settlers and the Civil Administration increased activities to strengthen \ncontrol over sensitive locations in the old city of Hebron (H2 area) that have been \ndeclared “closed military areas” since the late 1990s. On 6 July 2022 and 18 April \n2023, unknown persons used bulldozers to demolish two buildings hosting 12 \nPalestinian shops in the old vegetable market. The Palestinian owners reportedly \ncomplained to the Israeli police, but there was no follow-up. The area is off-limits to \nPalestinians and heavily monitored by Israeli security forces.

Between 3 and 10 May, the Civil Administration delivered eviction orders for \nthree Palestinian properties in the area of the old municipality headquarters, claiming \nthem as “State land”. According to Israeli media, the Government of Israel had \nannounced plans to transfer ownership of some 70 buildings in H2 to settlers.65  \n \n \n \nEast Jerusalem \n \n38. After Palestinians fatally shot Israeli civilians in East Jerusalem in January \n2023, the Minister of National Security of Israel ordered the police to expedite \ndemolitions and “bring back order” in the city.66 February saw the highest number of \ndemolitions in East Jerusalem in a single month since 2019,67 raising concerns of \ncollective punishment. At least a third of all Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem lack \nIsraeli-issued building permits and are therefore at risk of demolition. 68 Collective \npunishment is expressly prohibited by international humanitarian law 69  and is \nincompatible with several human rights obligations.70 The Committee against Torture \nconsiders that the policy of punitive house demolitions violates article 16 of the \nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment.71 \n39. On 17 May, Israeli authorities demolished two buildings comprising three \nhomes each in the Wadi Qaddum area of Silwan and forcibly evicted 39 Palestinians \n(7 men, 10 women and 22 children), citing lack of a building permit.  \n40. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem face the threat of forced eviction \nfollowing claims initiated mostly by settler organizations 72 to take over Palestinian \nproperty, in particular in the Old City and surrounding areas. On 11 May, After a 45-\nyear legal battle, the Israeli authorities notified Nora Gaith (67 years old) and Mustafa \nSub Laban (72 years old) that, at any time after 11 June 2023, they would be forcibly \nevicted from their home in the Old City, the home in which Ms. Gaith was born in \n1955, if they did not leave voluntarily. Eviction proceedings were initiated by the \nGaletzia Trust, which is associated with the settler organization Atara Leyoshna, \nclaiming ownership of the property on the basis of the 1970 Legal and Administrative \nMatters Law, which is inherently discriminatory against Palestinians in relation to \nrestitution rights for property allegedly owned before 1948.73 \n41. Under the discriminatory planning regime of Israel, demolitions and resulting \nforced evictions entail numerous violations of human rights,74 including the right to \n__________________ \n \n65 Hagar Shezaf, “Netanyahu government pledges to advance transfer of swaths of West Bank lands \nto pre-1948 Jewish owners”, Haaretz, 12 January 2023. \n \n66 Para. 49; Josh Breiner, “Ben-Gvir, Israel’s police chief spar over expediency of East Jerusalem \nhome demolitions”, Haaretz, 14 February 2023; https://twitter.com/itamarbengvir/status/ \n1619671180998504451?s=46; and https://twitter.com/itamarbengvir/status/ \n1619967010292768770?s=46. \n \n67 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “West Bank demolitions \nand displacement: an overview”, January–March 2023.  \n \n68 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “High numbers of \ndemolitions: the ongoing threats of demolition for Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem”, \nHumanitarian Bulletin: Occupied Palestinian Territory, January 2018. \n \n69 Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 33; and Hague Regulations, art. 50.  \n \n70 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 2 and 14; International Covenant on \nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, arts. 6 and 11; and A/76/333, para. 35. \n \n71 CAT/C/ISR/CO/5, para. 41. \n \n72 A/76/336, para. 35. \n \n73 A/72/564, para. 30. \n \n74 Ibid., para. 25. \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554\n \n11/20\n23-20717 \n \nadequate housing,75 and are contrary to international humanitarian law.

Forcible transfer and the extensive destruction and appropriation of \nproperty not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly \nmay constitute grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention and thus amount to \nwar crimes.79  \n \n \n \nCoercive environment and forcible transfer \n \n42. Since the High Court of Justice of Israel approved their eviction in May 2022,80 \npressure has mounted on some 1,150 Palestinian residents of 12 Palestinian herding \ncommunities to leave the Israeli-designated Firing Zone 918 in Masafer Yatta. The \nIsraeli authorities demolished or confiscated 33 structures, 81  including a donor-\nfunded school in Isfay al-Fawqa, carried out military drills and set up checkpoints, \nseverely restricting access to water, education and humanitarian assistance. after the \nHigh Court of Justice handed down its judgement, which is inconsistent with \ninternational law,82 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \nRights (OHCHR) has documented that settlers continued to live in and operate farms \nin the area, thereby helping to negatively affect essential living conditions for \nPalestinian herders. From 2 to 5 May, settlers from a newly established outpost \noverlooking the hamlet of Maghayir al-Abid blocked Palestinians’ access to their \ngrazing lands and water cisterns and attacked Palestinians. On 4 May, settlers \nphysically attacked a Palestinian shepherd and killed two of his sheep. As Palestinians \ngathered to protest, Israeli security forces arrested and detained the shepherd for five \ndays.83 In February, the Israeli authorities announced that they would retroactively \nlegalize the Avigail outpost, 84 although it is located partially in Firing Zone 918, \nwhich is the reason that Israel has used to justify the eviction of the Palestinian \ncommunity. In the light of the data presented above on enforcement of the rules \nrelated to illegal construction, this case appears to illustrate the differentiated \ntreatment that Israeli authorities give to settlers with regard to the enforcement of \nrestrictions on construction in the firing zone, to the detriment of Palestinians. 85  \n43. Several herding communities near Ramallah were forced to leave their homes \nunder similar coercive conditions, raising concerns that they may have been forcibly \ntransferred. 86  In February, six families consisting of 37 persons, including 21 \nchildren, left their community of Wadi al-Siq, north-east of Ramallah, following the \narrival of a group of settlers with some 200 sheep. The Settlers set up a tent 1 km \naway, took control of water sources and grazing land, and started harassing the \n__________________ \n \n75 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 11. \n \n76  A/77/493, para. 66. \n \n77  A/HRC/43/64, para. 44. \n \n78  Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 53; and Hague Regulations, arts. 46 and 55–56.  \n \n79 Fourth Geneva Convention, arts. 49, 53 and 147; Hague Regulations, arts. 46 and 56; and \nA/HRC/52/76, para. 26. \n \n80 A/HRC/52/76, para. 52; and A/77/493, para. 19. \n \n81 Data from the United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \n \n82  A/HRC/52/76, para. 52; A/77/493, para. 19; and OHCHR, “UN experts alarmed by Israel high \ncourt ruling on Masafer Yatta and risk of imminent forcible transfer of Palestinians”, 16 May \n2022.  \n \n83 Data from the United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \n \n84 See para. 17 and note 37 above. \n \n85  See also, A/76/336, paras. 55–57. \n \n86 A/HRC/49/85, para. 29. \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554 \n \n23-20717\n12/20 \n \ncommunity daily. On 22 May, the Bedouin herding community of Ayn Samiyah, east \nof Ramallah, consisting of 26 families and 132 residents (27 men, 37 women and 68 \nchildren) dismantled their homes and left after settlers tried to take their sheep.87 By \n31 May, they had resettled in different locations in Area B. The community had been \nliving under the pressure of settler violence, reduced grazing land and repeated \ndemolitions. Previously, in July 2022, about 100 people had been forced to leave their \ncommunity of Ra’s al-Tin.88 More than 1,000 herders have been displaced in similar \ncircumstances since the beginning of 2022. Settler violence and the failure to hold \nperpetrators accountable, together with Palestinians’ inability to obtain approvals to \nbuild, demolitions, evictions, movement restrictions and ongoing settlement \nexpansion have created a coercive environment that contributes to displacement that \nmay amount to forcible transfer, which is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva \nConvention. \n44. On 7 May, the High Court of Justice rejected a petition from the settler \norganization Regavim demanding the immediate eviction of 190 Palestinians from \nthe Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar and accepted that the Government would \ndecide when to carry out the eviction based on reasons of “national security and \nforeign relations”. 89  The community remains at risk of forcible transfer. 90  The \nAdditional Minister in the Ministry of Defence responsible for settlement policy \nstated that the inhabitants would be evicted not because of the site’s illegality, but \nbecause it was located in “the area that will decide if … there will be territorial \ncontiguity that will connect Bethlehem with Nablus and Ramallah”. 91  \n \n \n \nB. Settlement-related violence  \n \n \n45. Settler violence against Palestinians almost doubled, with 1,003 incidents \nresulting in Palestinian deaths, injuries and/or property damage. Settlers killed \n6 Palestinian men and injured 368 other Palestinians (289 men, 39 women and 40 \nchildren). In addition, two Palestinians (one man and one boy) were killed either by \nIsraeli security forces or settlers. A total of 2,109 Palestinians were injured and at \nleast 6 were killed by Israeli security forces in settler-related incidents. Settlers \nvandalized more than 16,740 Palestinian-owned trees and saplings and 943 vehicles, \ndamaged homes and crops, and killed or stole livestock.  \n46. Attacks by Palestinians against Israelis also spiked. In the West Bank, \nPalestinians killed 24 Israelis (16 men, 4 women, 3 boys and 1 girl), of whom three \nwere members of the Israeli security forces, and injured at least 136 Israelis, \naccording to Israeli sources.92  \n47. Settler attacks further escalated in gravity, with increased use of live \nammunition and increased incidents of arson of Palestinian houses and vehicles by \nmobs of settlers. On 26 February, hundreds of settlers terrorized Huwwarah and \nnearby communities after two settlers were killed by Palestinians.

Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states \nthat any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to \ndiscrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.  \n48. Citing self-defence, settlers commonly carry firearms and are encouraged by \npolitical leaders at the highest level, such as the Minister of National Security, to use \nthem against “terrorists”,94 without facing significant restrictions or accountability. \nOn 6 April, During Ramadan, an Israeli settler living in an outpost in the Old City of \nJerusalem shot, for no apparent reason, at a 14-year-old Palestinian boy from a \ndistance of 1 m. The boy had returned home shortly after midnight to find the gate to \nhis home barred by the settler. After a brief verbal altercation, the settler shot the boy \nin the neck and then in the arm. The Israeli police arrested the settler on the same day \nand released him on house arrest shortly thereafter. On 27 January, a Palestinian man \nkilled six Israelis (four men, one woman and one boy) and one Ukrainian woman in \nthe settlement of Neve Ya‘aqov, in occupied East Jerusalem. Later in the evening, a \nsettler driving by the entrance of Bayta on Road 60 rolled down the car window and \nshot repeatedly at Palestinians gathered in the street who were seemingly celebrating \nthe attack against the Israelis. The settler injured five Palestinian men with live \nammunition and drove off. \n49. Significant settler violence continued to emanate from settler outposts. Settler \nattacks and daily harassment from outposts appeared to be designed to terrorize \nPalestinians, make the lives unbearable and take over their land. 95 \n50. Kisan, a village of 600 people south of Bethlehem, has been increasingly \ntargeted by settlers from surrounding outposts and settlements. Nine attacks against \nthe village were recorded, 96 mostly from the settlement of Ma‘ale Amos and the \noutpost of Ibei HaNahal, resulting in damage or injuries. For instance, on 19 October, \na Palestinian couple was accompanied by Israeli and international activists to harvest \ntheir olive trees near Ma‘ale Amos. They passed by a tent that had been set up by \nsettlers on their land a week earlier and found most of their more than 300 olive trees \nalready harvested and sprayed with chemicals. Shortly afterwards, 30 masked settlers \narmed with clubs and stones arrived and beat up and injured the couple and at least \nthree women activists, including a 70-year-old Israeli woman who lost consciousness \nduring the attack. The couple told OHCHR they did not report the attack to the police \nbecause they feared that the Israeli authorities would revoke the man’s medical permit \nfor cancer treatment in Jerusalem in reprisal. Herders in the village stated that, owing \nto settler violence and daily harassment, they were resorting to buying fodder for their \nanimals instead of grazing them in lands near settlements and outposts, resulting in \nfinancial loss. \n51. OHCHR documented an increasing number of cases where Israeli security \nforces actively supported or joined settler attacks. In one case, on 21 October, a \nsettlement security guard wearing the uniform of the Israeli security forces was caught \non camera handing a teargas grenade to a settler attacking Palestinians in Burin, near \nNablus, during the olive harvest.97  \n52.

Convictions were secured in only 3 per cent of those cases. In 81.5 per \ncent of cases, the Israeli police closed the investigation primarily on the grounds that \nthe offender was “unknown” (64 per cent) or for “insufficient evidence” (21 per cent), \nindicating a failure in the investigation.98 In stark contrast, between 2018 and 2021, \n96 per cent of cases opened by military prosecutors against Palestinians ended in \nconviction, clearly indicating discriminatory law enforcement. 99 In 38 per cent of the \ncases, Palestinians chose not to file a complaint, owing to lack of trust in the Israeli \nauthorities or fearing retaliation.100 Of additional concern, out of all the indictments \nissued against settlers, 26 per cent included Israeli children as offenders.101 \n53. Settler violence has not been adequately prevented and there is a lack of \neffective investigation into such violence resulting in widespread impunity for those \nresponsible, including members of the Israeli Security Forces who participate in \nsettler attacks. Under international humanitarian law, the occupying power must \nprotect the protected population against all acts or threats of violence.  \n \n \n \nCase study \n \n \n \nState-backed settler violence in Huwwarah, Nablus Governorate \n \n54. Huwwarah, Burin, Aynabus, Urif, Madama and Asirah al-Qibliyah are \nPalestinian towns at the bottom of Jabal Salman mountain, south of Nablus, with a \ntotal population of around 21,000 inhabitants. Traditionally, these communities relied \non farming and herding for their livelihood. Pursuant to the Oslo Accords, the built-\nup areas of the towns were designated as being part of Area B and most surrounding \nlands as being part of Area C. In 1983, the settlement of Yitzhar was built on top of \nthe mountain, on land belonging to the six villages. As additional settlements and \noutposts were built, the Palestinian communities progressively lost access to their \nlands and were subjected to settler violence. \n55. Huwwarah is located on Road 60, the main artery connecting the West Bank \nfrom north to south. The town became an important trading centre because of its \nlocation and the fact that farmland became increasingly off-limits to Palestinians. By \n2022, it had 8,000 inhabitants and 400 establishments, including restaurants, grocery \nshops, car showrooms and repair centres. \n56. In 2017, Israeli authorities reportedly approved the construction of a highway \nto connect Jerusalem to settlements south of Nablus, 102 bypassing Huwwarah to the \neast. Set to open in 2024, the road will be 5.5 km long, have four lanes, four bridges \nand several crossings. 103  Its construction required extensive expropriation of \nPalestinian land, including 406 dunums of private land104 confiscated by the Civil \nAuthority from Palestinians primarily from the towns Huwwarah, Bayta and Awarta. \nIn addition to that land, a further 1,100 dunums were seized for the building of the \nroad. According to the Israeli authorities, the road will resolve traffic congestion and \nalso benefit Palestinians. However, the road, the construction of which has already \nrequired the destruction of trees in Palestinian lands, as well as properties and \n__________________ \n \n98  Yesh Din, “Data sheet, December 2022: law enforcement on Israeli civilians in the West Bank \n(settler violence) 2005–2022”, 1 February 2023. \n \n99  A/78/502, para. 43. \n \n100  Yesh Din, “Data sheet, December 2022”. \n \n101  Data from Yesh Din (on file with the Secretariat). \n \n102 Mainly Yitzhar, Itamar, Har Bracha and Alon Moreh.

Settler harassment and attacks in Huwwarah and surrounding towns have \nsteadily increased. The number of attacks increased during the reporting period to 70, \ncompared with 12 attacks in 2020 and 14 attacks in 2021.  \n58. On 26 February, approximately 400 settlers from Yitzhar and other nearby \nsettlements gathered and attacked Palestinians with stones, batons and Molotov \ncocktails, and set fire to homes, shops and vehicles in Huwwarah and nearby towns. \nThe rampage occurred several hours after an armed Palestinian man had shot and \nkilled two settlers (aged 19 and 21) from the settlement Har Brakha as they were \ndriving through Huwwarah, and a few days after Israeli security forces had killed 12 \nPalestinians, including one child, in an operation that was conducted in broad daylight \nin the old city of Nablus.105 \n59. During multiple and simultaneous settler attacks that lasted for hours, one \nPalestinian man was killed by either Israeli security forces or settlers (see para. 66 \nbelow) and 387 other Palestinian were injured (161 men, 137 women, 46 boys and 43 \ngirls) in the towns of Huwwarah, Za‘tarah, Burin and Bayta, of whom 378 were \ninjured by Israeli security forces and 9 by settlers. According to the Israeli security \nforces, one soldier was injured by settlers. Settlers caused extensive property damage, \nestimated at $5 million by the municipality of Huwwarah. at least 37 homes were set \non fire or vandalized, resulting in the displacement of 78 Palestinians. In addition, at \nleast eight commercial structures were burned down and 55 Palestinian privately \nowned vehicles and 1,200 scrapped vehicles were torched.106  \n60. Given their traditional caregiver role, women were mostly at home with children \nat the time of the attack, in many cases without husbands and fathers. They accounted \nfor most of the Palestinians who were injured as settlers attempted to torch buildings. \nA 29-year-old mother of three told OHCHR that, from her window, she saw about 200 \nsettlers, accompanied by several Israeli soldiers, approaching Yitzhar junction. The \nSettlers threw stones at Palestinian homes. They then approached the car park of her \nhusband’s business and set fire to some 100 vehicles parked there. The smoke around \nthe house became so intense, the woman and children feared that they would be \nburned alive. The woman, looking for breathable air, took her children, including a \ntwo-year-old, to the roof of the building. She stayed there with another neighbour and \nher three children, in the dark, until 2330 hours. The family business sustained \n1 million new Israeli shekels ($250,000) in damage. The woman described several \nmembers of the Israeli security forces moving “back and forth” as the arson was \noccurring, without acting to stop the settlers. Illustrating the strong psychological \nimpact that the event had had on Palestinian residents, several families told OHCHR \nthat children refused to sleep in their houses for days after the rampage, fearing \nfurther attacks.  \n61. Settler-related violence negatively affects women’s mobility, further reinforcing \nnegative aspects of traditional gender roles. In one case documented by OHCHR, a \nPalestinian woman reported that her husband had not allowed her to go out of the \nhouse alone, not even for grocery shopping, since the attacks and following the \ndeployment of Israeli security forces snipers on a floor of their building to protect \nsettlers.  \n__________________ \n \n105 A/78/502, para. 16. \n \n106 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “Protection of civilians: \nOccupied Palestinian Territory”, 14–27 February 2023.  \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554 \n \n23-20717\n16/20 \n \n62. In the hours preceding the rampage, settlers reportedly had been organizing on \nsocial media, with calls made on dozens of WhatsApp groups to concentrate in \nHuwwarah and attack Palestinians. 107 Although the Israeli Defense Forces central \ncommand responsible for army troops in the West Bank called the attacks a “pogrom” \nand “terror”, it stated that Israeli security forces were caught off guard by the number \nof attackers and the scale and intensity of violence. 108  \n63. Yesh Din stated that, in most of the cases that it documented, the victims refused \nto file a criminal complaint because they did not trust the Israeli authorities, given \nthat Israeli security forces were present during the rampage. Multiple videos and \ntestimony taken by OHCHR, other organizations and the media all indicate that many \nsettlers were masked and carried out the attacks as groups of Israeli security forces \nstood by them, but without intervening. OHCHR documented cases where Israeli \nsecurity forces fired tear gas canisters, rubber-coated metal bullets and live bullets at \nPalestinians who attempted to defend themselves by throwing stones at settlers.  \n64. At 2000 hours, approximately 20 to 30 settlers coming from Huwwarah \napproached the village of Za‘tarah and started throwing stones. A larger number of \nPalestinians gathered and responded by also throwing stones, forcing the settlers to \nwithdraw. At about 2015 hours, some 60 settlers returned with a settlement security \nguard and three Israeli army jeeps. The settlers again threw stones at Palestinians. \nWhen Palestinians responded in a similar fashion, Israeli soldiers and civilians fired \nlive ammunition at them. One shot hit Sameh Aqtash in the abdomen; he died shortly \nafterwards from his wounds. Another Palestinian man was injured by live \nammunition. As at 31 May, there was no information publicly available on any \ninvestigation by Israeli security forces.  \n65. Far from being isolated, this case fits into a well-established pattern of \ndiscriminatory law enforcement in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Settler \nand Israeli security forces activities and use of firearms are increasingly interwoven, \nwith their distinction becoming increasingly difficult to discern as these events, \nincluding the killings, show.109 \n66. Some Israeli leaders from extreme right-wing political parties that are in power \npraised the 26 February violence and incited further violence against Huwwarah, \nwhich is perceived as associated with Palestinian attackers. Those statements have \nincluded calls for the “erasure” of Huwwarah. A Member of the Knesset from the \ncoalition stated “a closed, burnt Huwwarah, that is what I want to see”. 110 A few days \nlater, the Additional Minister in the Ministry of Defence, speaking on radio, said that \nIsrael should “wipe out” Huwwarah.111 Although other Israeli officials condemned \nthe statement and the Additional Minister partially retracted his words, a campaign to \n“erase” the town continued and became viral on social media.112 The Attorney General \nof Israel has reportedly opened an investigation for incitement against the Member of \nKnesset.113 \n__________________ \n \n107 Gianluca Mezzofiore and others, “Israel’s military called the settler attack on this Palestinian \ntown a ‘pogrom’.

Israeli security forces stated they would thoroughly investigate the incident. 114 \nAlthough hundreds were involved in the rampage, the Israeli police only arrested \neight settlers on 1 March. The following day, an Israeli court ordered all eight to be \nreleased, reportedly because no evidence was presented against them. 115 On the same \nday, the Minister of Defence issued four-month administrative detention orders \nagainst two of those who were released, including a 17-year-old boy suspected of \ninitiating the rampage and attacking Israeli security forces, as well as “previous acts \nof terror”. 116  The Central District Court of Israel shortened the administrative \ndetention period from four months to two months for the boy, who was released on \n2 April, and reduced by one month the detention period for the adult, who was \nexpected to be released on 2 June 2023. There was widespread criticism and outrage \namong public figures and Israeli politicians, who said that placing the two in \nadministrative detention without charge or trial, a practice extensively used against \nPalestinians,117 was “anti-democratic”.118 On 13 March, two settlers from the outpost \nof Giv’at Ronen were arrested by the Israeli police on suspicion of involvement in \nthe Huwwarah riots and taken for interrogation by the Israel Security Agency. 119 \n68. The Huwwarah rampage demonstrates, in addition to a lack of criminal \naccountability for the perpetrators, how difficult it is for Palestinians to claim \ncompensation for damages caused by Israeli settlers. According to the organization \nLegal Aid for Palestinians, which is representing eight Palestinian families that are \nsuing the Israel Defense Forces for damages for failing to protect them, it is difficult, \nif not impossible, to prove a civil case if no perpetrator is identified by authorities. \nOn the other hand, the Israeli government had made no offer of compensation as at \n31 May.  \n69. Emboldened by political backing and impunity, settlers returned to attack the \ntowns of Huwwarah, Za‘tarah, Burin and Qaryut in the following weeks. On 6 March, \nat night, Israeli settlers were captured on closed-circuit television cameras assaulting \na Palestinian family in their car, including a 2-year-old girl, with an axe, stones and \npepper spray. A 61-year-old man was injured in the head. In a rare development, on \n30 March, an Israeli prosecutor charged two settlers in relation to the attack.120 On \n27 March, groups of Israeli settlers again entered Huwwarah and carried out attacks, \ninjuring six Palestinian men, and burned or vandalized five homes, three shops and \n17 vehicles.  \n70. In response to attacks by Palestinians and settler “price tag” attacks, the Israeli \nsecurity forces imposed movement and other restrictions on Palestinians only, \npurportedly to prevent violence. Following the events of 26 February and until \n3 March, Israeli security forces closed Huwwarah to Palestinian traffic and forced all \nshops and business to shut down. The town was shut down again for two days after \nthe 27 March attacks. In subsequent weeks, Israeli security forces also closed the road \nconnecting Bayta to Huwwarah and all side streets leading to the Huwwarah main \n__________________ \n \n114 Emanuel Fabian, “Suspects in Huwara settler rampage out of custody; IDF vows to probe \n‘lawlessness’”, Times of Israel, 28 February 2023. \n \n115 Emanuel Fabian, “Two suspects in Huwara rampage, one a minor, sent to administrative \ndetention”, Times of Israel, 28 February 2023. \n \n116 Elisha Ben Kimon, “Settler officials intervene for teen suspected of setting fire in Huwara”, \nY Net News, 18 May 2023. \n \n117  Ibid. \n \n118  A/78/502, para. 37. \n \n119 Hagar Shezaf, “Two settlers placed in administrative detention over Huwara riot”, Haaretz, \n13 March 2023. \n \n120 Emanuel Fabian, “Two settlers charged with terror for attack on Palestinians in Huwara”, Times \nof Israel, 30 March 2023.  \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554 \n \n23-20717\n18/20 \n \nroad with earth mounds, leaving some families completely isolated for several days. \nMeanwhile, settlers had free passage through the town. \n71. The livelihood and activity of shop owners in the main street of Huwwarah were \ndeeply impacted. As at 31 May, Israeli security forces maintained a significant \npresence in the town, including a new military post and snipers deployed in residential \nbuildings. According to several shop owners, Israeli security forces have harassed \nthem and their customers by stopping passers-by and checking their identification \ndocuments and issuing fines, thereby deterring potential customers. All of them \nreported that their income has been reduced by half or more since the February \nattacks. \n72. In most cases of settler violence, Israel has repeatedly failed in its responsibility \nas the occupying Power to protect the Palestinian population.  \n73. Systematic and increasingly severe settler violence committed with the \nacquiescence and support of Israeli security forces, including arbitrary use of force, \nputs at risk Palestinians’ rights to life and security of the person. 121  \n74. Settler violence, the presences of Israeli security forces and Israeli plans for \nsettlement expansion have, in combination, further exacerbated a coercive \nenvironment in the area and increased the risk of forcible transfer.  \n \n \n \nV. Settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan  \n \n \n75. Eighteen months have passed since the Government of Israel announced its goal \nto “double the population of the Golan Heights” in order to “advance the interests of \nthe State of Israel.”122 According to the government’s projected rate of growth, the \nsettler population in the occupied Golan will increase by 23,000 before 2027. As a \nresult, the number of settlers has, for the first time, exceeded the local Syrian \npopulation of 28,000.123 \n76. On 20 June 2023, Israel commenced work on 23 wind turbines in orchards near \nthe towns of Majdal Shams and Mas‘adah in the occupied Syrian Golan. Israeli police \nprovided on-site protection for works reportedly124 carried out by Energix, an Israeli \ncompany. As a result, clashes erupted between Syrians protesting against the \nconstruction of the wind turbines and Israeli police, reportedly resulting in minor \ninjuries to three protesters and three police. \n77. Settlement expansion and such commercial activity as the construction of wind \nturbines, which could potentially have a detrimental effect on the health of the \npopulation of the occupied Syrian Golan, further worsen the overall human rights \nsituation and continue to limit the Syrian population’s access to land and water, in \nviolation of a wide range of their human rights, including the rights to food, health \nand adequate housing. \n \n \n \nVI. Conclusions and recommendations  \n \n \n78. The establishment and expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan amount to the transfer by \nIsrael of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, which is \n__________________ \n \n121  A/HRC/49/85, para. 19; A/76/336, para. 19. \n \n122 A/77/493, para. 69. \n \n123 Supported by information received from NGOs working on the Syrian Golan. \n \n124  See Adi Hashmonai and Jack Khoury, “Druze protesters clash with police in Golan Heights over \nwind turbine construction”, Haaretz, 20 June 2023. \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554\n \n19/20\n23-20717 \n \nprohibited under international humanitarian law, as consistently confirmed by \nthe competent United Nations organs, including the International Court of \nJustice.125 It may also amount to a war crime.126 \n79. Settlement of titles constitutes an irreversible act of sovereignty by a \npermanent regime and subverts the principle that occupation is inherently \ntemporary.127 Ongoing action in this regard in the occupied West Bank, including \nEast Jerusalem, is illegal under international law and increases the risk of illegal \nappropriation of property and of forcible transfer.  \n80. The transfer of wide administrative powers relating to settlements and land \nadministration from the military to Israeli civilians could facilitate annexation \nin violation of international law, including the Charter.  \n81. The alarming increase in violence by settlers, including violence against \nwomen, with the acquiescence and support of the Israeli security forces and the \ncontinuing widespread impunity for such acts highlight the unwillingness of the \nIsraeli authorities to uphold its obligations as the occupying Power to ensure as \nfar as possible public order and to protect the Palestinian population against all \nacts or threats of violence. In addition, Israeli security forces often apparently \nused unlawful force, including unnecessary or disproportionate use of such lethal \nweapons as firearms, against Palestinians during settler attacks. Settler violence \nadversely affects the rights of Palestinian people, including the rights to security \nof person, freedom of movement, privacy, family life, an adequate standard of \nliving, work and education, and it is an important component of the coercive \nenvironment that may leave some Palestinians no other choice than to leave their \nplaces of residence.  \n82. Systematic demolitions of Palestinian homes, based on discriminatory laws \nand policies, are ongoing and result in forced evictions, a gross violation of \nhuman rights.128 Forced evictions resulting from demolitions in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory are a key factor in the creation of a coercive environment. \nThey have a negative impact on a wide range of human rights, including women’s \nrights, and increase the risk of forcible transfer. \n83. There was an almost total failure to ensure accountability for apparent \nunlawful killing of Palestinians, including in instances that raise concerns of \nextrajudicial executions and wilful killing. This is indicative of the climate of \nimpunity that prevails with respect to excessive force against Palestinians by \nIsraeli security forces, including in the contexts of settlement.  \n84. The Secretary-General recalls Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in \nwhich the Council decided that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, \njurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights was null \nand void and without international legal effect. \n85. The Secretary-General recommends that Israel: \n \n(a) \nImmediately and completely cease and reverse all settlement activities \nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in compliance \nwith international law, including relevant United Nations resolutions, such as \nSecurity Council resolution 2334 (2016); \n__________________ \n \n125  A/76/336, para. 59. \n \n126 Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 49(6); and Rome Statute, art. 8(2)(b)(viii). \n \n127 Hague Regulations, arts. 43 and 55; and A/77/493, para. 72. \n \n128  Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/28, para. 1. \n\n\n---\n\nA/78/554 \n \n23-20717\n20/20 \n \n \n(b) \nImmediately halt demolitions and forced evictions of the Palestinian \npopulation and cease any activity that would further contribute to a coercive \nenvironment and/or lead to a risk of possible forcible transfer; \n \n(c) \nIn line with its obligations as the occupying Power to protect the \nPalestinian population, issue clear and unambiguous orders to Israeli security \nforces to ensure the protection of the Palestinian population against settler \nviolence and hold to account members of the Israeli security forces who fail to \ncomply with such orders; \n \n(d) \nEnsure that all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli security \nforces against Palestinians, including violence against women, and damage to \ntheir property are promptly, effectively, thoroughly and transparently \ninvestigated; that perpetrators are prosecuted and, if convicted, punished with \nappropriate sanctions; and that victims are provided with effective remedies, \nincluding adequate compensation, in accordance with international standards; \n \n(e) \nImmediately cease and reverse all settlement development and related \nactivities in the occupied Syrian Golan and end discriminatory land, housing and \ndevelopment policies, in compliance with relevant United Nations resolutions. \n86. The Secretary-General further recommends that all States take all \nmeasures necessary to effectively ensure respect for applicable international \nhumanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, by all \nparties to the conflict. \n \n"

Introduction \n \n \n1. \nThe present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 78/78 \nand provides an update on the implementation of the resolution from 1 June 2023 to \n31 May 2024. It is based on direct monitoring and information-gathering conducted \nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) \nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and on information provided by Government \nsources, United Nations entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The \nreport should be read in conjunction with related reports of the Secretary-General and \nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted to the General \nAssembly and the Human Rights Council.1 \n2. \nThe report contains an update on settlement advancement and its impact on the \nhuman rights of the Palestinian people. Section III highlights settler violence against \npastoral communities, which, combined with Israeli policies, has forced the \ndisplacement of those communities in unprecedented numbers, compared with \nprevious reporting periods. It also contains an update on Israeli settlements in the \noccupied Syrian Golan. \n \n \n \nII. Legal background \n \n \n3. \nInternational human rights law and international humanitarian law apply \nconcurrently in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, namely, Gaza and the West Bank, \nincluding East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. This includes the Geneva \nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth \nGeneva Convention), which is binding upon Israel as the occupying Power. A detailed \nanalysis of the applicable legal framework can be found in previous reports of the \nSecretary-General.2 \n \n \n \nIII. Update on settlement activities \n \n \n \nA. Legal and policy initiatives of the Government of Israel \n \n \n4. \nThe advancement of settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, \nand the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population to the occupied West Bank, \nincluding East Jerusalem, has been ongoing for decades.3 Policies of the current \nGovernment of Israel are aligned to an unprecedented extent with the goals of the \nIsraeli settler movement to expand long-term control over the West Bank, including \nEast Jerusalem, and to steadily integrate the occupied West Bank into the State of \nIsrael.4 The expansion of settlements in the West Bank along with settler violence, in \nmany cases with the acquiescence and support or participation of Israeli security \nforces, have led to numerous human rights violations. \n5. \nThe year 2023 was already on track to having the highest recorded number of \nPalestinian fatalities, including child fatalities, since the United Nations began \nsystematically recording casualties in 2005. On 7 October 2023, Hamas and other \nPalestinian armed groups launched large-scale attacks in Israel. The attacks included \nthe commitment of numerous acts of terror in southern Israel, in the Gaza periphery, \nwhile thousands of rockets were launched towards population centres in Israel. Since \n__________________ \n \n1 See A/HRC/55/72; and A/HRC/55/28. \n \n2 See A/HRC/34/38; and A/HRC/34/39. \n \n3 A/HRC/52/76, para. 2; and A/78/554, para. 4. \n \n4 A/HRC/55/72, para. 6. \n\n\n---\n\nA/79/347\n \n3/20\n24-16501 \n \n7 October 2023, Israeli sources have reported that more than 1,500 Israelis and \nforeign nationals were killed in that context, including at least 338 women and 38 \nchildren, and 690 members of the security forces. In addition, some 250 people, \nincluding both Israelis and foreign nationals, including approximately 65 women and \n34 children, were abducted and taken into Gaza, with some subsequently released in \nNovember during a seven-day humanitarian pause. The subsequent Israeli military \nresponse resulted in a catastrophic situation for the 2.1 million inhabitants of Gaza, \nwith more than 40,700 Palestinians killed by the date of reporting, according to the \nMinistry of Health in Gaza, the majority of whom were women or children, in major \npart as a result of the means and methods of warfare of Israel.  \n6. \nSince the attacks of 7 October 2023, there has been a further marked expansion \nof settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Violence \nby the Israeli security forces and settlers against Palestinians increased dramatically \nand continued during the reporting period, further entrenching the discriminatory and \noppressive system of Israeli control over Palestinians. 5 \n7. \nThe transfer of authority to approve the demolition of illegal structures in \nsettlements to the Finance Minister of Israel, who serves as an additional Minister in \nthe Ministry of Defense, under the new Civil Administration, 6 which began in May \n2023, has reportedly led to a sharp decrease in law enforcement operations against \nsettlers.7 On 2 September 2023, the Government of Israel confirmed that the \nadditional Minister had cancelled the establishment of a “special enforcement unit” \nintended to address violations of planning and construction laws by settlers, 8 which \nraised concerns that law enforcement operations against unauthorized Israeli \nconstruction in settlements would be further scaled down.  \n8. \nOn 29 May, the Head of the Israel Defense Forces Central Command and the \nHead of the Civil Administration (both military officers) issued two orders appointing \na new civilian deputy for civilian affairs and delegating to him most of the authority \nof the military Head of the Civil Administration over the administration of the West \nBank. The new deputy reports on substantive matters to civilian officials within the \nMinistry of Defense and is only operationally subordinate to the military chain of \ncommand.9 Those orders effectively redistributed powers from military to civilian \nofficials, as agreed in the coalition agreements and the agreement between the \nMinister for Defense and the additional Minister.10 Such structural changes11 ensure \nthat, while the military chain of command retains responsibilities for security-related \nissues, the management of most areas of settlement advancement, land development, \n__________________ \n \n5 Ibid., para. 8. \n \n6 A/78/554, para. 6. \n \n7 Hagar Shezaf, “Since Smotrich appointment, Israel nearly stopped enforcing law on illegal \nsettlement construction”, Haaretz, 2 July 2023. \n \n8 State response dated 9 September 2023 in High Court of Justice of Israel, Peace Now v. the \nMilitary Commander of the West Bank, Case No. HCJ 2368/18, Ruling of 9 May 2024. See  פסק -\n ד ין בתיק בג ”\n ץ \n2368/18 (court.gov.il).  \n \n9 Order No. 2195 amended Israeli Military Order No. 947 (1981) to allow the delegation of \nauthority from the head of Civil Administration to a deputy head for civilian affairs, answerable \nto the Civil Administration under the additional Minister in the Ministry of Defense, and to \ntransfer the authority of the legal counsel in the Military Advocate General’s Office to civilian \nlawyers within the Ministry of Defense. In a subsequent order the Head of the Civil \nAdministration appointed the deputy head of civil administration for civilian affairs and \ndelegated all authorities listed in the previous order to him, see \n צו -\n בדבר -\n הקמת -\n מינהל -\n אזרחי -\n תיקון -\n מס -\n3\n3\n -\n יהודה -\n והשומרון -\n מס -\n2195\n -\n תשפד -\n2024\n.pdf (www.idf.il); and \n כתב -\n מינוי -\n והאצלת -\n סמכויות -\n לסגן -\n ראש -\n ה מינהל -\n האזרחי -\n לעניינים -\n אזרחיים.pdf (www.idf.il). \n \n10 A/78/554, para. 6; and A/HRC/55/72, para. 7. \n \n11 A/78/554, para. 6. \n\n\n---\n\nA/79/347 \n \n24-16501\n4/20 \n \nplanning and day-to-day life in Area C, as well as the legal advice that management \nrelies upon, are vested with the additional Minister and his appointees in the Ministry. \n9. \nThe above delegation of administrative powers relating to land administration \nand settlements to Israeli civilian officials answerable to the additional Minister, \nelected and accountable to the population of Israel, appears to give further effect to \nthe Government of Israel’s “application of sovereignty” over the West Bank12 and to \nconsolidate the incorporation of the West Bank into the territory of Israel. According \nto the International Court of Justice, this amounts to annexation in violation of \ninternational law, including the Charter of the United Nations. 13 These changes reflect \nthe facts on the ground, namely, that Israel has been administering the West Bank as \nits own territory and in a manner that discriminates against the protected population. 14 \n10. On 18 June, the Government of Israel simplified the approval process for Israeli \nsettlement construction in the West Bank and expanded the authority of the additional \nMinister to approve one of the construction stages. 15 Those changes have rendered \nthe approval processes for construction by Israeli communities essentially identical \nfor developments within Israel and inside settlements within the West Bank, further \nintegrating the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, into Israeli territory.  \n11. Further steps were taken to extend the jurisdiction of Israeli local government \nentities to Israeli settlements and to ensure that Israeli settlers receive the same \nservices as Israelis within Israel, further blurring the distinction between the exercise \nof sovereignty on Israeli territory and the administration of settlements in the West \nBank.16 On 1 April, the Knesset amended the Municipalities Ordinance, enabling the \nMinister of the Interior to distribute revenues between municipalities proximate to \none another, including municipalities in West Bank settlements. 17 In March, the \narmy’s Central Commander ordered the provision of cellular coverage on all roads \nserving settlements in the West Bank.18 On 22 May, the Knesset passed, in a \npreliminary reading, a private bill to bring settlements from the South Hebron Hills \ninto the jurisdiction of the Negev Hills local authority, to benefit from the budget of \nthe Negev Development Authority.19 \n12. According to the NGO Peace Now, Israeli authorities continued to increase \nbudgets to settlements; funds for settlements were set to amount to more than \n737 million shekels (some $200 million) in 2024, more than the 275 million shekels \n($74 million) budgeted in May 2023, with 20 per cent of the Transportation Ministry \nroad construction budget to be directed to settlements.20 In addition to having obtained \nthe imposition of financial sanctions on mobile phone companies if they violate their \ncoverage obligations in the West Bank “similar to the rest of the country”, the \nCommunications Ministry announced a plan to establish a cellular infrastructure in \nthe West Bank during 2024, with a dedicated budget of 50 million shekels. 21  \n__________________ \n \n12 Ibid., para. 5. \n \n13 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, \nI.C.J.

The situation in the West Bank was accompanied by calls by some Israeli \nMinisters and Members of the Knesset for the “voluntary migration” of Palestinians \nfrom Gaza and the re-establishment of settlements there.22 On 22 May, the Minister \nfor Defense also announced the cancellation of the order prohibiting Israelis from \nentering areas in the northern West Bank. This follows the partial repeal of the 2005 \ndisengagement law, under which Israel officially withdrew from the northern West \nBank and Gaza, and raises concerns over the potential establishment of future \nsettlements there.23  \n14. During the first half of 2024, several Member States announced targeted \nrestrictive measures on certain individual settlers accused of violence. 24 According to \nOHCHR monitoring, those measures do not appear to target those most responsible \nfor settler violence.  \n \n \n \nB. Settlement expansion \n \n \nAdvancement, including planning, tenders and construction \n \n15. Further steps were recorded towards the establishment and expansion of illegal \nsettlements, including planning, tenders and construction, as well as the demolition \nof Palestinian structures, resulting in high numbers of displaced Palestinians. The \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that Israeli settlements \nin the West Bank had already expanded by a record number by 30 April 2024, and \nthat infrastructure developments, including roads that service-only settlements, \njeopardized any practical possibility of a contiguous Palestinian State. 25 \n16. There has been a record surge in settlement activities since 7 October, 26 \nincluding the construction of outposts, roads, fences and roadblocks initiated by \nsettlers with the endorsement or acquiescence of authorities. 27 Settlers increasingly \nseized control of Area C in the West Bank, marginalizing the Palestinian population. \nThis was reportedly supported, planned and promoted by the Israeli authorities, \nincluding through funding farming outposts.28 \n17. According to Peace Now, on 3 March, the Israeli Ministry of Housing \ncommenced construction on a new settlement, known as “Amirim Neighborhood” or \n“Ariel West” in central West Bank. Although not bordering any other settlement, \nIsraeli authorities stated it was part of the existing Ariel settlement. The construction \neffectively disconnects the Palestinian villages north of Salfit, such as Kifl Haris and \nHaris, from the rest of Salfit district.29 \n__________________ \n \n22 OHCHR monitoring.

As the International Court of Justice reaffirmed in its 19 July advisory opinion, \n“the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem … have been established \nand are being maintained in violation of international law”.30 The Court further stated \nthat “Israel’s policies and practices, including the maintenance and expansion of \nsettlements, the construction of associated infrastructure, including the wall, … \namount to annexation” and that “to seek to acquire sovereignty over an occupied \nterritory … is contrary to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations \nand its corollary principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force”.31  \n \nPlans and tenders  \n \n19. The advancement of plans for settlement construction increased further, \nfollowing the increase in the previous reporting period. Plans for the construction of \nsome 19,500 housing units were advanced or approved, including 11,300 in Area C \nand 8,200 in East Jerusalem. Overall, there was a 19 per cent increase in housing units \nadvanced in East Jerusalem and Area C. This saw an 86 per cent increase in East \nJerusalem and an 8 per cent increase in West Bank, respectively.32 Furthermore, Israel \npublished tenders inviting bids from construction firms for approximately 1,600 \nhousing units, including approximately 1,200 for East Jerusalem. This compares with \ntenders for approximately 1,350 new settlement housing units (1,260 in Area C, 90 in \nEast Jerusalem) in the previous reporting period.  \n20. Meanwhile, there were 490 construction starts of housing units in Area C \nbetween 1 July 2023 and 31 March 2024, compared with approximately 1,200 \nbetween 1 July 2022 and 31 March 2023.33 \n21. In 2023, the highest ever number of construction plans was promoted in West \nBank settlements, including in East Jerusalem, including 24,700 housing units being \nadvanced, approved or tendered – more than double the 2022 number.34 For example, \non 2 June, the Higher Planning Committee deposited a plan for the “Sha’ar Shomron” \nindustrial zone, which design would create a “settlement continuum” in the area. The \nindustrial zone would be the largest in the West Bank, nearly 2,700 dunams, with \nanticipated severe environmental impacts.35 \n22. On 13 December, Israeli authorities approved the Lower Aqueduct plan, on both \nsides of the Green Line, adjacent to Kibbutz Ramat Rachel and the Palestinian \nneighbourhoods of Beit Safafa and Sur Baher. This was the first new major settlement \nto be approved in East Jerusalem since 2012. Its construction further threatens the \nviability of a contiguous Palestinian State as it would create a continuum between \nGivat Hamatos and Har Homa settlements, cut off East Jerusalem from Bethlehem \nand isolate Beit Safafa from the rest of East Jerusalem, further fragmenting the \nPalestinian population in East Jerusalem.36 On 18 April, Israeli authorities published \na tender for the construction of 1,047 houses in the settlement. \n \nDeclaration of “State land” \n \n23.

Israeli authorities declared around 10,800 dunams of land in the West Bank \n“State land” since the start of 2024, marking a new peak. On 29 February, 2,640.3 \ndunams were declared “State land” in the Palestinian villages of Abu Dis and \nel-Azariya, between Ma’ale Adumim and Keidar settlements and in the southern part \nof the so-called “E1” settlement project. This development places three Palestinian \ncommunities, (Abu Nuwar, Wadi Abu Al-Suwan, Abu Hindi) and more than 1,000 \npeople at risk of forcible transfer. On 20 March, an extensive area of 8,000 dunams \nin the Jordan Valley was declared “State land”,39 the largest such declaration since \nthe Oslo Accords. On 1 April, the Civil Administration declared as “State land” \n170 dunams (42 acres) of land surrounding an archaeological site east of Bethlehem \nand near the Etzion settlement bloc.40  \n \nOutposts  \n \n25. According to Peace Now, during the reporting period, Israeli settlers established \n30 new outposts, 22 of them after 7 October. The new outposts follow contiguous \nlines, fragmenting the land, further diminishing the viability of a Palestinian State. \nParticularly after 7 October, settlers established new roads, fences and obstacles that \nreshaped the geography of Area C and the West Bank. 41 Settlers constructed 20 new \nroads between October and January alone, with many more constructed subsequently. \nSettlers also erected fences and other obstacles to block Palestinian access to large \namounts of land, roads and services.  \n26. While outposts are illegal even under Israeli law, there is a consistent pattern of \nIsraeli authorities’ involvement, assistance and financing of the construction of \noutposts,42 as well as their operation,43 and their retroactive “regularization”. For \nexample, on 2 August, the High Court of Justice of Israel dismissed a petition seeking \nthe eviction of the illegal Homesh outpost in northern West Bank and restoring \nPalestinian landowners’ access to their adjacent land. Although the court based its \ndecision on the grounds that the outpost had been relocated from privately owned \nPalestinian land,44 access to the relocated outpost still passes through it, thus \npreventing Palestinians from gaining access to their land. \n27. OHCHR monitored attacks by settlers from outposts on Palestinian \ncommunities, which contributed to their displacement. Settlers also appropriated \nPalestinian land, increasing the risks of permanent displacement and of those \ncommunities’ forcible transfer. For example, in the Barriyet Tuqu area, settlers \n__________________ \n \n37 A/HRC/52/76, para. 8. \n \n38 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, paras. 120 \nand 122. \n \n39 Office of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, “Security Council briefing \non the situation in the Middle East, report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of UN \nSCR 2334 (as delivered by Special Coordinator Wennesland)”, 26 March 2024.  \n \n40 OHCHR monitoring.  \n \n41 OHCHR, “The human rights situation in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem: \n7 October–20 November 2023”, 27 December 2023, para. 34.  \n \n42 OHCHR monitoring.  \n \n43 Ibid.

Consolidation of settlements \n \n \nRetroactive regularization of outposts \n \n28. In the reporting period, Israeli authorities “legalized” one outpost. On \n25 February, the Israel Defense Forces Central Command commander signed an order \nredefining the jurisdiction of “Mishmar Yehuda” outpost near Al-Ubediya, east of \nBethlehem,45 effectively turning it into a large urban settlement with over 417 dunams \nof land.46 On 27 March, the Civil Administration announced plans to incorporate the \nAhiya outpost into the Shilo settlement,47 which would effectively “legalize” the \noutpost, set up in 1997, under Israeli law.  \n29. On 20 April, Israeli media reported that the Finance Minister and additional \nMinister in the Ministry of Defense had instructed various government ministries to \nallocate budgets and provide services to 68 outposts. 48 This followed a Cabinet \ndecision49 from February 2023 and coalition agreements to treat outposts as if they \nwere legal for the purposes of budgets and services and to refrain from enforcing \ndemolition orders, bypassing legalization procedures. 50  \n \n \n \nIV. Impact of settlements on human rights \n \n \n30. Israeli military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the \naccompanying violent attacks and human rights violations perpetrated by Israeli \nsettlers and Israeli security forces, and the long-standing discriminatory system under \nwhich Israel exercises control over Palestinians, continued to subvert the rights of the \nPalestinian people, including their right to self-determination.51 \n31. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that Israel \nsubjected the Palestinian people to “long-standing systematic discrimination, \noppression and violence”.52 The International Court of Justice recently concluded that \na number of Israeli policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory were \ninconsistent with the obligations of Israel under international human rights treaties, \nincluding the prohibition of racial segregation and apartheid under article 3 of the \nInternational Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. 53  \n \n \n__________________ \n \n45 Information from the Office of the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. \n \n46 OHCHR monitoring.  \n \n47 Ibid.  \n \n48 Hagar Shezaf and Jonathan Lis, “Israel’s Finance Minister orders ministries to provide services, \ninfrastructure to illegal West Bank outposts”, Haaretz, 21 April 2024. \n \n49 See www.gov.il/BlobFolder/pmopolicy/dec6b-2023/he/dec-b6150323.pdf. \n \n50 OHCHR monitoring.  \n \n51 A/HRC/55/144, para. 5; A/78/554, para. 29; A/75/376, paras. 13, 40 and 62; and A/HRC/52/75, \npara. 2. \n \n52 A/HRC/55/72, para. 8. \n \n53 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, paras. 154, \n197, 206, 213, 222, 223, 229 and 238–243. \n\n\n---\n\nA/79/347\n \n9/20\n24-16501 \n \n \nA. Housing, land and property rights \n \n \nDemolitions, forced evictions and risk of forcible transfer \n \n32. Demolitions and seizures of Palestinian-owned structures continued across the \nWest Bank, including in East Jerusalem. On 19 July, the additional Minister in the \nMinistry of Defense announced a new border police unit, focusing on the enforcement \nof planning laws, and the expansion of enforcement to Areas A and B. 54 On 7 April, \nIsraeli authorities transferred land enforcement authority, which Israel applies also in \nEast Jerusalem, to the Minister of National Security, 55 who has repeatedly made calls \nto intensify demolitions of Palestinian structures.  \n33. Israeli authorities demolished 1,277 Palestinian-owned structures, including \n459 inhabited residential buildings and 62 donor funded structures. This represents a \nsharp increase from 1,056 structures demolished and 1,194 displaced in the same \nperiod between 2022 and 2023, and represents the highest numbers recorded since \n2009.56  \n34. Israeli authorities demolished, seized or forced the owners to demolish 913 \nstructures lacking Israeli-issued building permits, which remain almost impossible \nfor Palestinians to obtain. The Civil Administration acknowledged that 95 per cent of \nPalestinian building permit applications in Area C are rejected. Over the past 20 years, \non average less than 10 permits per year have been granted to Palestinians. 57 \n35. Israeli authorities demolished at least 10 structures in Area C, under Military \nOrder 1797, which provides for the demolition of so-called “new” structures. It gives \nresidents 96 hours’ notice of demolitions and limits legal remedies.58 \n36. 156 Palestinian communities (comprising 2,664 Palestinians, including 766 \nmen, 750 women, 579 girls, 593 boys) suffered total or partial displacement. Bedouin \nand other herding communities were especially affected, with 138 structures \ndemolished, affecting 999 people and displacing 213 people (47 women, 48 men, 63 \ngirls, 54 boys). Displacement increased after 7 October: at least 54 Palestinian \nhouseholds from 12 herding communities, comprising 115 people (26 women, 28 \nmen, 34 girls, 27 boys) were displaced.  \n37. Demolitions in East Jerusalem remained of particular concern, particularly \nfollowing 7 October. Since 7 October, a total of 142 demolitions were undertaken in \nEast Jerusalem, including 77 of inhabited residential structures. In the three months \nfollowing 7 October alone, 63 demolitions were undertaken in East Jerusalem, \nmarking an 85 per cent increase compared with the same period the previous year.  59 \n38. Displacement and the application of discriminatory laws continued to \nundermine the rights of Palestinian children to have access to education. 60 On \n17 August, shortly before the academic year started and following the displacement \n__________________ \n \n54 See https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/committees/foreignaffairs/news/pages/pr190723.aspx. \n \n55 See www.gov.il/he/pages/dec1677-2024.

The discriminatory housing, property and planning laws, policies and practices \nof Israel and the forced evictions arising therefrom, violate international law,62 \nincluding of Palestinians’ right to adequate housing,63 property, health, education, \nprivacy, food, water and sanitation, and work. The International Court of Justice \nrecently concluded that “Israel’s planning policy in relation to the issuance of \nbuilding permits, and … its practice of property demolition for lack of a building \npermit, which treats Palestinians differently from settlers without justification, \namounts to prohibited discrimination, in violation of articles 2, paragraph 1, and 26 \nof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 2, paragraph 2, of \nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and article 2 of \nthe International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination”.64  \n40. Women and girls are particularly affected. Demolitions and forced evictions \nmake them more vulnerable to gender-based violence when rendered homeless. In \none case monitored by OHCHR, a female head of household reported facing gender-\nbased violence while seeking accommodation following her displacement. In other \ncases, women have reported adverse impacts on their privacy. Women and girls also \nface increased water and sanitation challenges for menstrual hygiene, pregnancy, \ndelivery and lactation. In addition, they often bear a higher demand for unpaid care \nand support work, increasing exposure to gender-based violence.65  \n41. In its advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice recalled that, “under \narticle 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the destruction of real or personal \nproperty is ‘prohibited, except where […] rendered absolutely necessary by military \noperations’”, an exception that the Court was not convinced applied to these punitive \ndemolitions.66 The Court further concluded that Israeli “forcible evictions, extensive \nhouse demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement, often leave little \nchoice to Palestinians in Area C but to leave” and that Israeli “policies and practices \nare contrary to the prohibition of forcible transfer of the protected population \nunder […] article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.”67 \n \nEast Jerusalem \n \n42. The Israeli authorities advanced the destruction of private property in the \nneighbourhood of Al-Bustan, Silwan, to create a park beside an illegal Israeli \nsettlement. On 14 February, Israeli bulldozers demolished the house of Fakhri Abu \nDiab, spokesperson of the Silwan Land and Properties Committee, displacing 11 of \nhis family members, including 5 children.68 Like most houses in Al-Bustan, Abu \n__________________ \n \n61 OHCHR monitoring.

It was within an area designated \nby Israeli authorities as a “green area” following the unlawful annexation of East \nJerusalem. Thousands of Palestinians are at risk of forced eviction following planned \ndemolitions in Silwan, due to Israeli property, planning and zoning laws and policies \nthat officials apply unlawfully and discriminatorily against Palestinians.69  \n43. Israeli courts continued to order the eviction of Palestinians in East Jerusalem \nbased on the application of discriminatory Israeli laws to occupied East Jerusalem. 70 \nOn 11 April, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from the Shhadeh family, \nresidents of Batan al-Hawa, Silwan, against a 2022 eviction order.71 The refusal was \nbased on a claim that the Shhadeh family’s houses had been built on land that, prior \nto 1948, had been Jewish-owned. The Supreme Court gave the family until 1 June \n2024 to leave.72 The family are one of 84 Palestinian families in Batan al-Hawa, \ntotalling 700 people, who face eviction proceedings initiated by a settler organization  \nin its efforts to control the Silwan neighbourhood. On 15 April, the Israeli Magistrate \nCourt ordered the eviction of three Palestinian families from their houses in Sheikh \nJarrah neighbourhood, in favour of a settler real estate company, Nahlat Shimom. 73  \n44. Israeli authorities accelerated land titling in East Jerusalem. 74 According to \nIsraeli NGOs that monitor this process, procedures were advanced for at least 215 \nblocks, each comprising several plots of land and/or buildings. During the reporting \nperiod, settlement of land title was finalized in 17 blocks, raising to 39 the total \nnumber of blocks in which the process has been concluded since its inception five/six \nyears ago.75 According to Ir Amin and Bimkon, in 90 per cent of the 39 cases, the \nprocess was finalized in favour of Israeli settlers or the Israeli State.  \n45. For example, authorities advanced the processes in the Armenian Quarter of \nJerusalem’s Old City after Israeli settlers violently attempted to seize land when a \ndisputed land deal was cancelled.76 The settlement of land title appears aimed at \nsolidifying the settlers’ attempted seizure and limited the community’s ability to \ncontest the deal. \n46. The land titling process appears to be used to advance new settlements and \nexpand Israeli control over territory in occupied East Jerusalem. 77 It places thousands \nof Palestinians across East Jerusalem at risk of forced eviction and forcible transfer. \nLand titling amounts to application of Israeli domestic laws, with long-term effect, to \noccupied territory.

Movement restrictions imposed to facilitate settlement life and further \nsettlement encroachment on Palestinian land continued to render Palestinian \nlivelihoods unsustainable.79 After 7 October, Israel security forces and settlers \nincreasingly limited Palestinians’ access to main roads, fields and other villages, \nwhile facilitating the free movement of settlers, including possible perpetrators of \nviolence against Palestinians.80 Israeli security forces and settlers closed checkpoints \nand installed roadblocks to block Palestinians’ movement, particularly those near \nsettlements and outposts, further limiting their access to farmland. 81  \n48. For instance, between 7 and 10 October, settlers erected earth mounds blocking \nthe main point by which the Al-Muntar Bedouin community gains access to the \nnearest urban centre, As-Sawahira- Ash-Sharqiya. Since then, 100 families from the \ncommunity have been forced to use a 35-kilometre alternative road to gain access to \nresources, such as animal feed. The local school, serving 35 students, was forced to \nclose. In parallel, settlers from nearby Tsan Kidar Farm outpost prevented access to \nthe community’s fields and grazed their sheep on crops cultivated by the community. \nAfter legal aid organizations addressed the Civil Administration and petitioned the \nIsraeli High Court to challenge the closure, Israel Defense Forces Central Command \nordered the temporary seizure of the road for “security reasons,” allowing the \nrestrictions to continue. On 25 February, the High Court of Justice endorsed the order \nuntil 1 July.  \n49. These movement restrictions caused by the settlement project continue to \nundermine the social and economic rights by Palestinians in the West Bank. 82 For \ninstance, the diversion of water supplies from Palestinian villages to settlements \ninfringed residents’ access to basic amenities, while NGOs reported that run-off \nsettlement wastewater had an adverse impact on Palestinian farming. \n \nSettlements-related violence  \n \n50. The situation deteriorated after 7 October, following statements inciting \ndiscrimination, hostility or violence from multiple Israeli officials. 83 According to the \nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, during the reporting period, \nIsraeli settlers perpetrated 1,350 attacks against Palestinians causing injuries \n(including 55 caused by firearms), of which 991 were committed after 7 October.84 \n__________________ \n \n78 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, para. 139. \n \n79 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), “UNCTAD report exposes \neconomic strain on Palestinian welfare in West Bank due to Israeli restrictions”, 28 November \n2023; International Labour Organization, “Impact of the war in Gaza on the labour market and \nlivelihoods in the occupied Palestinian Territory”, Bulletin No. 4 (Beirut, 2024). \n \n80 Restrictions were already discriminatory before 7 October, see A/77/493, para. 13.  \n \n81 OHCHR documented catastrophic impacts on Palestinian communities.

Another 7 (6 men, 1 boy) were killed by either Israeli security forces \nor settlers, all after 7 October, and 484 were killed by Israeli security forces, also after \n7 October.85 This violence exacerbates a previously reported trend of rising human \nrights violations by settlers in recent years.86 \n51. During the reporting period, 24 Israelis (16 men, 4 boys, 4 women, including \n1 Palestinian citizen of Israel) were killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, \ndue to alleged attacks by Palestinians, 14 of whom (9 men, 3 women, 2 boys) were \nkilled after 7 October. Out of the 24 Israelis killed, 10 were members of the security \nforces.  \n52. Settler violence has been enabled by the complicity, acquiescence and support \nor participation of Israeli security forces. The lack of accountability that settlers enjoy \nis part of a well-documented State-sanctioned impunity, which in turn accelerated the \ndisplacement of Palestinians and created new facts on the ground. 87 Amid a marked \nincrease in incitement by Israeli authorities following the 7 October attacks, 88 some \nIsraeli officials appeared to condone and encourage settler violence, 89 even urging \nsettlement as a purported response to violence by individual Palestinians. 90 \n53. Thousands of settlers from “settlements defence squads”, many with a history \nof attacks against Palestinians, have been drafted into regional army battalion units \nsince 7 October,91 stoking a trend of significant attacks by known settlers armed and \nin Israeli military uniform.92 This has been accompanied by State supply of weapons \nto “settlement defence squads”,93 contributing to increased violence against \nPalestinians. OHCHR monitored dozens of incidents of harassment and attack of \nPalestinians by members of Israeli security forces known to be settlers.  \n54. Palestinians continued to be denied equal protection, with particular challenges \nconcerning access to justice for women and girls.94 According to Yesh Din, police \nfailed to successfully investigate 81 per cent of the 1,664 Israeli attacks on \nPalestinians filed by the NGO between 2005 and 2023. Moreover, 93.7 per cent of all \ninvestigations were closed without an indictment, and only 9 of the 107 indictments \nsecured a conviction.95 Of the 1,437 cases where Israeli police gave reasons for \nclosing investigations, 64 per cent were because the offender was “unknown” and 20 \n__________________ \n \n85 Overall, Israeli security forces killed 562 Palestinians in the West Bank, including East \nJerusalem during the reporting period.  \n \n86 United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “UN and partners assess \nurgent humanitarian needs of herding communities in the occupied Palestinian Territory amid \nincreased Israeli settler violence”, 4 August 2023. \n \n87 OHCHR, “The human rights situation in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem: \n7 October–20 November 2023”. \n \n88 A/HRC/55/28, paras. 50 and 69; and OHCHR, “The human rights situation in the occupied West \nBank including East Jerusalem: 7 October–20 November 2023”. \n \n89 OHCHR monitoring.

Case study: displacement of herding communities \n \n \n55. Bedouin and other herding communities have been especially vulnerable to \nsettler attacks aimed at taking over large swathes of Area C, causing displacement of \ncommunities in unprecedented numbers during the reporting period. Violence, threats \nof violence and the application of discriminatory property and planning laws create a \nclimate of fear and intimidation that has compelled persons in multiple communities \nto abandon their homes, lands and communities. In total, 267 households comprising \n1,623 people, including 777 children, were displaced; of those, 233 households \ncomprising 1,395 people, including 659 children, were displaced after 7 October.97 \n56. The cases below demonstrate the trends monitored by OHCHR. Settlers, \nincreasingly armed with firearms, have conducted an organized campaign targeted at \nBedouin and herding communities south and east of the West Bank central mountain \nrange. They attack and intimidate communities at gunpoint, demand that they leave \ntheir homes and lands, and impose restrictions interfering with their livelihood and \naccess to basic necessities. Settlers encroach on Palestinian land and prevent \ncultivation or grazing, including by deploying drones and vehicles to scare and scatter \nlivestock, stealing and killing livestock and damaging farm property. Settler takeover \nof Palestinian grazing areas has led to the displacement of numerous communities. 98 \n57. The displacement of Palestinian communities is accompanied and driven by the \nestablishment of settler outposts on Palestinian land. Eleven shepherding outposts, \namassing 100,000 dunams, are estimated to have been constructed between 7 October \nand end of April.99  \n58. The displacement of Bedouin and other herding communities is facilitated by \ndiscriminatory Israeli property and planning processes. For example, following settler \ndestruction of herder structures, planning legislation is cited by the Civil \nAdministration to prohibit displaced communities from rebuilding structures in Area \nC,100 making their return impossible and their displacement permanent. \nSimultaneously, the State expropriates land for the benefit of Israeli settlers. For \nexample, the declaration of 2,640.3 dunams101 as “State land” will effectively displace \nmultiple Bedouin communities in favour of Israeli settlements.  \n59. Israeli security forces have accompanied, supported or participated in many \nattacks on herder communities, for example by shooting at Palestinians or seizing \nPalestinian livestock,102 contributing to the displacement of herding communities. \nIsraeli security forces have also supported and participated in the takeover of \nPalestinian land and the construction of outposts. In addition, they have obstructed \n__________________ \n \n96 Ibid., p. 9. \n \n97 Compare with “over 1000” herders reportedly displaced by settler violence between the \nbeginning of 2022 and end of May 2023, see A/78/554, para. 43.

OHCHR has monitored multiple \ncases in which Israeli security forces cite “state of war” for declining to aid \ncommunities facing settler violence and to justify closures of vital roads. \n \nKhirbet Zanuta  \n \n60. Khirbet Zanuta, in the south Hebron hills, is an established non-refugee, \nnon-Bedouin herding community that represents the last Palestinian herder \ncommunity in a band of growing settler-controlled land in Area C of south Hebron. \nIsraeli settlers have allegedly strategically targeted herders, with the apparent \nintention of forcing them to leave.106 Their displacement consolidates the settlers’ \npresence, while preventing Palestinian access to huge swathes of herding land.  \n61. Residents suffered five attacks between 12 and 28 October, including physical \nassault of children and women by armed settlers, as well as threats to kill their whole \nfamilies. According to the head of the village council, violence and threats against \nthe community forced more than 30 families of 250 people, including some 100 \nchildren, to leave the village between 28 October and 2 November. They have been \nunable to return to their homes, and the displacement risks becoming permanent.  \n62. Israeli settlers installed fences and dismantled the remaining infrastructure, \nimpeding the residents’ return, destroying 10 structures by 10 December, including \nthe donor-funded Zanuta Mixed School on 22 November.107 Settlers maintained an \nunwavering presence in Zanuta, marking the site with Israeli flags and graffiti, 108 and \npreventing residents from visiting or harvesting their olives. 109  \n63. Israeli authorities have directly contributed to preventing the Zanuta community \nfrom returning by designating the site a “closed military zone” and prohibiting the \nrebuilding of destroyed structures on account of a lack of building permits. 110 On \n2 May, following a petition on behalf of residents of Zanuta, the High Court of Justice \nordered the State to specify measures intended to ensure the return of the residents, \ntheir safety and the security of their property and livestock, in addition to \naccountability measures related to previous attacks.111 \n \nTuqu’ wilderness  \n \n64. Tuqu’ wilderness surrounds the town of Tuqu’, south of Bethlehem, comprising \nherding land and 800 dunams of olive orchards cultivated by Palestinian farmers. \nPrior to October, several Palestinian families had already been displaced. However, \nafter 7 October, settlers intensified pressure on the Palestinian families in Tuqu’ to \nleave.

According to the Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, between 8 October and 2 November, 20 \nPalestinian families comprising 145 persons including 40 children were displaced.  \n65. On 8 October, armed settlers entered the community several times at night \nthreatening to kill the residents if they did not leave. On 13 October, Israeli security \nforces killed a 26-year-old unarmed man who was trying to circumvent the closure \nand access the area. On 15 October, armed Israeli settlers, accompanied by Israeli \nsecurity forces, demolished one agricultural property and occupied another. On \n17 October, a group of armed settlers on quadbikes threw stones at four herders and \nchased them away, threatening to kill the herders if they saw them again. On \n23 October, settlers vandalized and stole a family’s property, looting equipment and \nbulldozing two animal sheds.  \n66. Displaced community members told OHCHR that they fled with their livestock, \nleaving their homes and farming infrastructure. Of the last eight families displaced, \nfour are staying with residents of Sa’ir, while four have relocated to Tuqu’ village, \nwhere pastureland scarcity renders grazing impossible. The attacks and displacement \nhave devastated displaced residents, exacerbated by a lost olive harvest, destruction \nof farmland and death of livestock. One resident remarked that “the future is \nunpredictable” and that they risk losing their “main source of income.” \n67. Settlers and Israeli security forces appear to have acted in concert to prevent \nresidents’ return. OHCHR observed that settlers had destroyed infrastructure 112 and \nfarming equipment, including a network of donor-funded water pipes connecting the \nwilderness with the Tuqu’ Municipality, while simultaneously installing caravans, \nroads and electricity links to the Teko’a and Nikodim settlements. Between 7 October \nand 11 May, according to Kerem Navot, settlers built at least four new outposts 113 and \nfour new roads on Palestinian land in Tuqu’, appropriating more than 550 acres, \nmaking it the largest such seizure by a single Israeli settlement (Teko’a).114 In tandem \nwith State-supported violence, on 1 April, Israeli authorities declared 171 dunams \nsurrounding the nearby Herodion archaeological site as “State land”.115 \n \nAl-Mu’arrajat \n \n68. Al-Mu’arrajat community in the Jordan Valley is also at risk of displacement. \nThis Bedouin community of the Kaabneh tribe, comprises three villages totalling 250 \nPalestinians, situated between the lowlands of the Jericho governorate, northeast of \nJericho and the highlands northwest of Jericho, on both sides of the Al-Mu’arrajat \nroad in Area C.  \n69. Settlers from Mevot Yorihu settlement have attacked Palestinians, throwing \nstones at them and subjecting them to insults and threats, as part of a harassment \npattern. On 26 October, Israeli settlers reportedly placed dolls, doused with red dye \nto imitate blood, on the doors of the Arab Al-Kaabna School. When these same dolls \nwere used again in a settler attack on 23 January to adorn three settler-built mock \nchild graves116 120 metres from the Al-Kaabna school, it sparked “intense fear” \namong residents.117 Settlers have killed and stolen sheep, affecting herders’ \n__________________ \n \n112 There are around 100 cisterns in the wilderness, many of them have been vandalized by the \nsettlers.  \n \n113 On file with the office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory of OHCHR.  \n \n114 Ben Hubbard, “In the West Bank, guns and a locked gate signal town’s new residents”, New York \nTimes, 1 June 2024.  \n \n115 On file with the office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory of OHCHR. \n \n116 OHCHR monitoring.

On 31 January, an Israeli settler from the Zohar outpost ran over 12 sheep \nbelonging to a community official, before stealing 10 others. Israeli security forces \nprovided armed support to settler violations, for example, by supervising the grazing \nof settler-owned sheep on Palestinian land. On 11 March, a new pastoral outpost was \nbeing established, comprising an area cordoned off using poles and chicken-wire \nfencing, and a small tarpaulin structure.118  \n70. The intensity of the takeover, violence and threats against the Al-Mu’arrajat \ncommunity have caused the residents in Al-Mu’arrajat centre to flee to Al-Mu’arrajat \nEast, leaving Al-Mu’arrajat centre completely empty. Nevertheless, Al Mu’arrjat East \ncontinues to be targeted, threatening the displacement from the entire Al-Mu’arrajat \nlands.  \n71. Systematic and increasingly severe settler violence contributed to a worsening \ncoercive environment, threatening Palestinian displacement from areas to which they \nhave traditionally been tied.119 Israel, as the occupying Power, has an obligation to \nrestore and ensure public order and civil life, while respecting the laws in force in the \noccupied territory, as well as international human rights law. 120 Evidence that the \nIsraeli security forces and Civil Administration have deliberately impeded Palestinian \ncommunities’ attempts to return to their homes raise concerns with respect to the \nIsraeli security forces’ support and approval of the displacement and an intention that \nthe displacement be permanent. The International Court of Justice recently found that \nsettler violence against Palestinians, impunity for settlers and the excessive use of \nState force against Palestinians contribute to “a coercive environment” and that \n“Israel’s systematic failure to prevent or to punish” such activity contravenes its \nobligations under article 46 of the Hague Regulations, article 27 (1) of the Fourth \nGeneva Convention, and articles 6 (1) and 7 of the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights.121  \n \n \n \nV. Settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan  \n \n \n72. Settlement expansion in the occupied Syrian Golan continued with the support \nof the Government of Israel. The General Assembly has recently reaffirmed that “the \nIsraeli settlements…in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal.”122 The expansion \ninvolved both an increase in the number of Israeli settlements and the Israeli settler \npopulation, as well as the advancement of commercial activities, 123 including the \napproval of the construction of a wind turbine project. 124 These measures align with \nthe plan of Israel to double the settler population in the occupied Syrian Golan by \n2027,125 with settlers already outnumbering the local Syrian population. 126 Israeli \nsettlers in the occupied Syrian Golan are currently distributed across 35 different \nsettlements.127 \n73. On 20 June 2023, Israel began work on a wind turbines near Majdal Shams and \nMas’adah in the occupied Syrian Golan.

The construction may also have potentially detrimental impacts on the \npopulation’s health and environment,131 including soil fertility and noise pollution. 132 \nThese potential environmental impacts, along with the loss of land near the turbines, \ncould threaten the community’s health and livelihoods by further limiting the Syrian \npopulation’s access to agricultural land and water.133 It could also restrict the villages’ \nability to expand, forcing residents into densely populated areas. 134 Farmers in \nparticular could face the dual challenge of losing land to cultivate while already \nstruggling to compete with subsidized settlement agriculture. 135 The project could \nthereby affect a wide range of human rights, including the rights to adequate food, \nwork and health, and the right to adequate housing,136 potentially leading to displacing \nthe Syrian population from areas to which they have traditionally been tied. The \nGeneral Assembly “condemn[ed]…any activities involving the confiscation of land, \nthe disruption of the livelihood of protected persons, the forced transfer of civilians \nand the annexation of land, whether de facto or through national legislation”.137  \n \n \n \nVI. Conclusions and recommendations  \n \n \n74. The establishment and continuing expansion of Israeli settlements in the \nOccupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan amount to the \ntransfer by Israel of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it \noccupies, which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, as \nconfirmed by the International Court of Justice.138 It may also amount to a war \ncrime.139 \n75. The International Court of Justice further concluded recently that “[t]he \nexpansion of Israel’s settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is based \non the confiscation or requisitioning of large areas of land” and that “these land \npolicies are not in conformity with articles 46, 52 and 55 of the Hague \nRegulations”.

The Court also held the following:  \nIsrael’s policies and practices, including the maintenance and expansion of \nsettlements, the construction of associated infrastructure, including the \nwall, the exploitation of natural resources, the proclamation of Jerusalem \nas Israel’s capital, the comprehensive application of Israeli domestic law in \nEast Jerusalem and its extensive application in the West Bank, entrench \nIsrael’s control of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, notably of East \nJerusalem and of Area C of the West Bank [and] amount to annexation of \nlarge parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.141  \nThe transfer of wide administrative powers relating to settlements and land \nadministration from the military authorities to Israeli civilians, erasing the \ndistinct administration of the occupied territory, further facilitates the process \nof annexation, in violation of international law, including the Charter of the \nUnited Nations.  \n77. The Secretary-General reiterates his strong condemnation of the horrific \nattacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Israel on 7 October \n2023 and the continued holding of hostages in Gaza. The scope of death and \ndestruction in Gaza as a result of the war that ensued has been unprecedented \nand horrifying. He unequivocally condemns the widespread killing and maiming \nof civilians in Gaza, including women and children. He reiterates his call for an \nimmediate ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all the \nhostages.  \n78. The increase in settler violence, especially after 7 October 2023, with the \nparticipation and support of Israeli security forces and continuing widespread \nimpunity, highlights the unwillingness of the Israeli authorities to uphold the \nobligations of Israel under the law of occupation, including the obligation to \nrespect family honour and rights, the lives of persons and private property in \noccupied territory.142 Settler violence adversely affects the enjoyment of the \nrights of Palestinian people, including the rights to security of person, freedom \nof movement, privacy, family life, an adequate standard of living, work and \neducation. It is a manifestly important factor in the coercive environment that \nforces many Palestinians to leave their homes.  \n79. Systematic demolition of Palestinian homes, on the basis of discriminatory \nlaws and policies, is ongoing and results in forced evictions. Forced evictions \nresulting from demolitions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are a key factor \nin the creation of a coercive environment. They have a negative impact on a wide \nrange of human rights, with an exacerbated impact on women and girls, and \nincrease the risk of forcible transfer. \n80. There was an almost total failure to ensure accountability for apparent \nunlawful killing of Palestinians, including in instances that raise concerns of \nextrajudicial executions and wilful killing. This is indicative of the climate of \n__________________ \n \n140 Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, paras. 120 \nand 122. \n \n141 Ibid., para. 173 \n \n142 Hague Regulations, art. 46. \n\n\n---\n\nA/79/347 \n \n24-16501\n20/20 \n \nimpunity that prevails with respect to excessive force against Palestinians by \nIsraeli security forces, including in the contexts of settlement. \n81. The Secretary-General recalls Security Council resolution 2334 (2016), in \nwhich the Council reaffirmed that the Israeli settlement policy in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory is a major obstacle to achieving a two-State solution and a \njust, lasting and comprehensive peace. He also notes that the International Court \nof Justice has held in this regard that the State of Israel is under an obligation to \ncease immediately all new settlement activities and to evacuate all settlers from \nthe Occupied Palestinian Territory. \n82. The Secretary-General recalls Security Council resolution 497 (1981), \nwhereby the Council decided that the decision by Israel to impose its laws, \njurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights was null \nand void and without international legal effect, and also recalls General \nAssembly resolutions reaffirming that the Israeli settlements in the occupied \nSyrian Golan are illegal.143 \n83. The Secretary-General calls on Israel to: \n \n(a) \nImmediately and completely cease and reverse all settlement activities \nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in compliance \nwith international law and relevant United Nations resolutions, such as Security \nCouncil resolution 2334 (2016); \n \n(b) \nImmediately halt demolitions and forced evictions of the Palestinian \npopulation and cease any activity that would further contribute to a coercive \nenvironment and/or otherwise contribute to forcible transfer; \n \n(c) \nIn line with its obligations as the occupying Power, issue clear and \nunambiguous orders to Israeli security forces to ensure the protection of the \nPalestinian population against settler violence and hold to account members of \nthe Israeli security forces who fail to comply with such orders;  \n \n(d) \nEnsure that all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli security \nforces against Palestinians, including gender-based violence, and damage to their \nhomes and property are promptly, effectively, thoroughly and transparently \ninvestigated; that perpetrators are prosecuted and, if convicted, punished with \nappropriate sanctions; and that victims are provided with effective remedies, \nincluding adequate compensation, access to justice, support and protection \nservices, in accordance with international standards; \n \n(e) \nImmediately cease and reverse all settlement development and related \nactivities in the occupied Syrian Golan and end discriminatory land, housing and \ndevelopment policies, in compliance with relevant United Nations resolutions. \n84. The Secretary-General further recommends that all States take all \nmeasures necessary and consistent with international law to effectively ensure \nrespect for applicable international law. \n \n__________________ \n \n143 General Assembly resolution 78/78. \n"
